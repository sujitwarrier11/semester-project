I believe the reason is that the lung diaphram gets too tired to pump
the liquid in and out and simply stops breathing after 2-3 minutes.
So if your in the vehicle ready to go they better not put you on 
hold, or else!! That's about it. Remember a liquid is several more times
as dense as a gas by its very nature. ~10 I think, depending on the gas
and liquid comparision of course!

Hence we are "all" above the Law where "all" in this case refers to
Christians.

When was the last time you heard about a Jewish animal sacrifice?

The blood sacrifice of an innocent man?

Then why don't Christians follow it, why don't they even follow their
own Ten Commandments?

You can get a *little* UV by putting a heavy UV filter (deep purple) in
front of an ordinary flashlight bulb (the brightest you can get).
My father used a setup like this in law enforcement work circa 1964.

Good UV ("blacklight") bulbs work like fluorescent bulbs.  I'd proceed by
getting a cheap battery-powered _fluorescent_ light, then going to an
electrical supply house and finding a UV bulb that would fit it.

The trouble with trying to find out the truth is that Roehm and his
buddies were ACCUSED OF being flaming faggots, one of the pretexts for the
Night of Long Knives in which Roehm and most of the SA wing of the NSDAP
were purged.  Since the accusers thereafter controlled the records,
anything bearing on the subject -- true or not -- has to be considered
tainted evidence.  The available data suggest that Roehm and his crowd,
the SA -- Sturmabteilung, "Storm Troopers" -- left the world a better
place when they departed, but concrete particulars are still no more than
more or less shrewd guesses.

I understand that the new GPS boxes now have an option
known as "differential ready".  Apparently land-based
beacons tranmit GPS correction information to your GPS 
receiver (with differential option installed).

How does this system work?  What frequency is used for
the land-based beacons?

Thanks in advance,

Comet Gehrels 3, which was discovered in 1977, was determined to have
been in a temporary Jovian orbit from 1970 to 1973.  Comet Shoemaker-Levy 1993e
may remain in orbit around Jupiter long enough to allow Galileo to
make some closeup observations.  The orbital trajectory for Comet
Shoemaker-Levy is still being determined.

Even a half a beer will increase your confidence while slugging your reactions

for any length of time without stacking the odds. I'll not ride after ANY.

I think that the Vincent is the wrong sort of bike for Satan to ride.
Honda have just brought out the CB1000 (look in BIKE Magazine) which
looks so evil that Satan would not hesitate to ride it.  17-hole DMs,
Levi 501s and a black bomber jacket.  I'm not sure about the helmet,
oh, I know, one of those Darth Vader ones.  There you go.  Satan.
Anybody seen him lately?  Just a cruisin'?

God would ride a Vincent White Lightning with rightous injection.
He'd wear a one-piece leather suit with matching boots, helmet and gloves.

For Immediate Release                             April 14, 1993     

	     
                       REMARKS BY THE PRESIDENT
                      AT SUMMER JOBS CONFERENCE

	     	  
                            Hyatt Regency
                        Crystal City, Virginia  


11:22 A.M. EDT

	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  The speech that 
Octavius gave says more than anything I will be able to say today 
about why it's important to give all of our young people a chance to 
get a work experience and to continue to learn, to merge the nature 
of learning and work; why it's important to honor the efforts of 
people like Jerry Levin and Nancye Combs and Pat Irving and all of 
those who are here.  
	     
	     I want to thank the Secretaries of Labor and Education 
and all the people who work with them for sponsoring this; and my 
good friend, Governor Wilder, for being here and for speaking; and 
all of the business and local community leaders from the city and 
county and state level from around America who are here. 
	     
	     This has been a pretty fun day.  (Laughter.)  I loved 
hearing the young people sing.  It was music to my ears because it is 
their future that we are really struggling about.  (Applause.)  A 
year and a half ago I began the quest to seek the presidency because 
I was concerned about their future.  Because I believe that our 
country, which had always been a beacon of hope for the young, had 
too little opportunity, was too divided among ourselves across lines 
of income and race and region and other ways, without a vision to 
take us into the future.  
	     
	     I entered with the hope that together we could create 
more opportunity and insist on much more responsibility from all of 
our people.  But in the process we might recreate the best of 
America's community, knowing that together we could always to more 
than we could individually and that we might secure our future.
	     
	     All of you here today are committed to that.  The 1,000 
jobs that Jerry Levin has committed Time-Warner to is symbolic of the 
commitments made by many of the private sector people who are here, 
and those who are around the country.  The work that Nancye Combs 
does, and the successes of all the young people like those on this 
stage, and especially the eloquent statement Octavius Jeffers -- all 
those things show that together we know what we need to do, and we're 
on the right track.
	     
	     Last July when I was traveling across America's 
heartland in my luxurious bus, I visited Seneca High School in 
Louisville, Kentucky.  And there I met young people and business 
people who were participating in the Louisville Education and 
Employment Partnership.  I saw what Nancye Combs talked about today.  
I saw how the young people were making an extra effort to succeed 
both in school and at work.  I saw, as I have seen many times in my 
own state, the principle illustrated that Octavius has talked about 
-- that for millions of American young people it is really an 
impediment to both their learning and their ability to be good 
workers to draw a sharp dividing line between what is work and what 
is learning.
	     
	     In the world in which we are living, the average young 
person will change the nature of work seven or eight times in a 
lifetime.  We must learn to merge the work world and the learning 
world much better.  And we must determine that all of our young 
people see the opportunities that some of them have had showcased 
here today.  
	     
	     Whether you're in business or in government or in 
education, you know that we have a big job to do when it comes to 
building a future that really, honestly includes opportunity for all 
of our people.  There are still a lot of people who say, well, things 
are pretty good here in Washington and everything's fine; the best 
thing we can do about this whole thing is nothing.  They all have 
jobs.  (Laughter.)  All the people who say that.  (Applause.)  
	     
	     They all have health insurance.  They all have a pretty 
good education.  And they all have a pretty secure knowledge that 
they'll be okay no matter what happens.  I say that not to be either 
political or unduly critical, but to point out that one of the great 
challenges of this age for every advanced nation -- everyone -- is to 
fully develop the capacities of all of its people, and then find work 
for them to do.
	     
	     All the European countries have higher unemployment 
rates than we do, but also stronger support systems for the 
unemployed.  The Japanese unemployment rate has been going up.  
They're going to adopt a stimulus that, even if you count it in its 
most rigorous terms, is three or four times bigger than the one that 
I have proposed to create jobs. 
	     
	     In West Germany alone, the unemployment rate is now 
about as high as ours.  This is a big problem for advanced nations.  
It costs a lot of money to add an extra employee, with a lot of 
pressure from low-wage producers in other countries that are growing 
their own economies and trying to provide new opportunity for their 
people.  
	     
	     But it is especially important for America for two 
reasons:  One is, we have a whole lot of folks who, unless we move 
aggressively, will not have the education and skills we need to be 
competitive and productive in a nation like this.  The second is, 
even if we educate them all, if there aren't jobs they will be robbed 
of the fruits of their educational labors.  People need to be able to 
work in this country.  (Applause.)
	     
	     We have always had some unemployment; and, indeed, some 
of it is normal.  You've always got some people leaving jobs and 
moving around the country and doing first one thing and another.  We 
have now, at this moment in our history, the necessity for all big 
organizations, including the government, to reexamine the way they 
are organized and who ask whether there are too many people working 
at some kinds of jobs.  But in the whole, we must still be able to 
create jobs in a country like America, to provide people with the 
chance to work.  
	     
	     It's going to be difficult for me to make the welfare 
reform proposals that I will make to Congress in the next couple of 
months -- it's going to be hard for me to make those work if, at the 
end of all this work, to get off welfare there isn't a job.  
(Applause.)
	     
	     So we have two tasks.  One is to develop the capacity of 
the American people to perform without regard to race or income or 
the circumstances of their birth.  The other is to make sure that 
there are some opportunities for them to bring to bear for their 
talent and to be rewarded with a paycheck.  It is a great challenge.  
I do not pretend that all of the answers are simple.  But I know if 
you want to ask the American people, all of them, to be more 
responsible, if you want to recreate a sense of community in this 
country that bridges the lines of race and income and region, you 
have got to have opportunity in that mix. 
	     
	     A part of our vision for America has to be a future for 
every young person in this country who's willing to play by the rules 
and work hard and strive for the end of the rainbow.  There has to be 
something at the end of that rainbow.  And that is what we are 
basically here to talk about today:  What can we all do as partners, 
recognizing none of us can do it alone, to develop the capacities of 
our people to succeed wherever they live and whatever their 
background.  And then, what can we do to make sure that there's 
something there for them to do?

	     The summer jobs program we're discussing today is an 
integral part of that plan, because it will promote the values of 
work and opportunity and fairness, community.  It will put the people 
first, and it does have a partnership between the public and private 
sector.
	     
	     I said when I addressed the United States Congress in 
February on this program that I would seek to create about 700,000 
extra summer jobs from government sources and then challenge the 
American business community to meet that target so that we can create  
more than a million new summer jobs over and above what had been 
created before.
	     
	     Many, many people have responded to that challenge.  And 
Jerry is just a shining example of that which has been replicated in 
this room and around the country -- people who are going to do more 
than they otherwise would in the private sector to give young people 
a work experience.  And it is terribly important.
	     
	     I want to emphasize that this summer jobs program is 
part of an overall commitment to increase the capacity of the 
American people -- from retraining defense workers who lose their 
jobs and other adults who need to acquire new skills; to improving 
the transition from school to work for young people who don't go to 
college but do need at least two years of post-high school training 
either on the job or in a community college or a vocational setting, 
so that they can be competitive workers, making it possible for more 
people to go on to college who do want to go.
	     
	     All these things are part and parcel of a comprehensive 
plan.  It's also important, as I said, that we create more jobs.  The 
emergency jobs program that I asked the Congress to adopt would 
create a half a million extra jobs over the next year and a half, and 
that would reduce the unemployment rate by a half a percent.  It 
would also enable us to absorb more young people coming into the work 
force in jobs that otherwise will not be created.
	     
	      It also will help a lot of cities and counties to 
invest in things that need to be done at the grass-roots level --
projects long delayed, water projects, sewer projects, park projects, 
new industries and particularly in small and medium-size communities 
-- a whole range of things that will improve the economy and improve 
the environment.  
	     
	     The summer jobs program is an important part of that 
because we have tried for the first time, through the work of the 
Labor Department and the Education Department and through reaching 
out to people like you, to make this more than just a one-shot summer 
jobs program; to integrate it with private sector efforts; to 
hopefully replicate it in each coming summer; to move these young 
people into further educational opportunities and to further job 
opportunities; and to have a strong, meaningful education component 
to these summer jobs -- something that the United States government 
has never fully emphasized before.  
	     
	     A lot of these young people, as you well know, because 
they come from difficult backgrounds, because they go to school in 
difficult and challenging circumstances, need extra help in building 
their basic skills in math and language, reasoning and in other 
areas.  And a lot of educational studies show that young people who 
have difficulty in school often forget as much as 30 percent of what 
they learn over the summer and then that has to be repeated the next 
year.  
	     
	     What we are trying to do here is to give people the 
opportunity to learn good work habits and to reinforce their learning 
skills and to put them together; and then, hopefully, over the next 
couple of years, if our entire program passes, to give every school 
in this country the opportunity to have a good work and learning 
environment.  
	     
	     There will be more applied academics, more opportunities 
for people to learn and work during the school year, so that this 
will not simply be an isolated moment for these young folks, but will 
be a part of building a whole new educational experience, a whole new 
work experience, and moving on a pathway to a better future.
	     
	     The summer jobs programs are not designed to be make-
work jobs.  They're designed to make a future for the people holding 
the job.  And that's what they will do.  In the process, they'll help 
to build local communities, to strengthen local economies, to solve 
local problems.  Real jobs -- renovating housing, repairing public 
buildings, doing clerical work, providing nursing assistance in 
hospitals, supervising and training children at child care centers, 
and learning all the way.  Challenging young people to learn while 
they earn, but letting them earn.
	     
	     You know, it's very difficult to make a case to people 
who have never seen opportunity on their own street that they should 
do this, that, or the other thing if there's no evidence of the 
opportunity that's at the end of the effort.  I have not been sparing 
in going for the last year-and-a-half into places where it isn't 
exactly popular to say it, and say I wanted to reform the welfare 
system; I wanted to toughen child support; I wanted to require people 
to work; I was sick and tired of people being irresponsible in the 
use of guns on the streets, and I wanted to change all that.  But if 
you're going to summon people to greater responsibility, you have to 
reward them when they do the right thing with opportunity.  
(Applause.)
	     
	     The young people we propose to put to work under our 
program will spend 90 hours learning basic skills, such as math, 
reading, writing -- either on the job in the classroom.  They will 
stretch their minds as well as work up a sweat.  They will have a 
sense of accomplishment.  It will literally be a summer challenge, 
but a challenge that will take them into a different life.
	     
	     So I want to ask all of you to support this effort even 
as I, as your President, support your effort.  At the end of the 
summer we will evaluate all the young people who participate.  We'll 
see whether they, instead of falling behind over the summer 
academically as too many young people do, they stayed even or moved 
ahead.  I suspect that they will.  
	     
	     This summer, Secretary Reich and Secretary Riley and I 
will be visiting many of your communities.  We'll really try to learn 
from you which of these efforts are working, what we should do next 
summer, how we can build it in to what goes on during the school 
year, how we can build in our job training efforts and the works that 
we do with your companies to make sense of this whole thing -- so 
that we maximize the impact of the taxpayer dollar and your private 
investments as well. 
	     
	     We want to honor the companies and the communities, the 
business leaders and the young people who do the very best jobs this 
summer.  And, again, I want to say to all of you in private business 
who have matched our effort, I thank you.  And to all of you who 
haven't, and those across the country who may listen or learn about 
this event today, I want to implore other private employers to 
stretch a little bit to give other young people a chance to work this 
summer.  I'm telling you, we cannot go through another 10 years when 
we don't give these children anything to say yes to.  If we exhort 
them to do right, we've got to be able to reward them.  (Applause.)
	     
	     When the other speakers were talking, I was sitting up 
here on the platform, listening and reveling.  And they got talking 
about work, and I got to thinking about all the different things I've 
done to make a living in my life.  When I was 13, I made a very 
foolish short-term business investment:  I set up a comic book stand 
and sold two trunks full of comic books.  Made more money than I had 
ever had in my life.  But if I had saved those trunks, they'd be 
worth $100,000 today.  (Laughter.)
	     
	     That does not mean young people should not be 
entrepreneurial.  It just means that you can't foresee a generation 
ahead.  I have mowed yards and cleared land and built houses and 
worked in body shops and the parts departments of a car dealership.  
And I've done a lot of different things for a living.  Some 
people say I got into politics to escape work.  (Laughter.)  
	     
	     I learned something from every job I ever had.  But I 
grew up in a generation where I literally did not know a living soul 
without regard to race or income who wanted to work who didn't have a 
job.  I grew up in a generation when all you had to really say to 
people is, get an education and you'll be all right.  You'll get a 
job and you'll make more money next year than you did this year.  Now 
I live in a generation full of people, most of whom don't make any 
more money in real dollars than they did 10 years ago and they're 
working longer hours and they're paying more for the basics of life.  
And we are now wondering whether we can create the jobs that these 
young people want.
	     
	     Now, I want to close by reemphasizing these two things:  
It doesn't matter what kind of economic policies this administration 
pursues, or how much productivity increases there are in the private 
sector, if young Americans don't get a good education, don't learn 
how to work and can't be productive, those jobs will not be created 
in this country.  Machines will do the work or the work will be done 
off-shore by people who have the same skill levels and can work for a 
third or a fourth or a fifth the wages.  So nothing we can do 
economically will matter unless we build the skills and capacities of 
America's work force.  And anybody that pretends otherwise is just 
kidding.  
	     
	     On the other hand, we need to be honest.  Every wealthy 
country in the world, including the United States, is having 
difficulty creating jobs.  If I knew everything that needs to be done 
I'd be glad to tell you and we   could just call off the whole 
deliberations of Congress and everything else.  I don't have all the 
answers.  But I know this:  Doing nothing is not the answer.  
(Applause.)
	     
	     And so the jobs program that I have presented to 
Congress, with the summer jobs, with the money for the cities and the 
counties, through the Community Development Program, with the 
infrastructure money, is a small part of a big budget.  It is an 
attempt to engage in an experiment to see whether or not, with the 
economy recovering in terms of corporate profit, we can give a little 
boost to it, give opportunities to young people, create a half a 
million jobs and maybe get the engine going again.
	     
	     Most of the jobs in this program are going to be jobs in 
the private sector, not government jobs, even though it's government 
money.  And the lion's share of the work in rebuilding the American 
economy obviously will come from the private sector.  That's the kind 
of system we have and it works pretty well.  
	     
	     But this is the challenge we have.  So I ask all of you 
here today to support the summer jobs program, to ask your friends 
and neighbors to support it, to go back home and ask your employers 
to make a little extra effort; to do what you can to help me pass the 
funds to create the 700,000 jobs that the United States government 
should create this summer, so that together we can have this 
partnership.  Because more than anything else, we have to give a 
future -- a future that our young people can believe in.  
	     
	     We need to send them a message that here in America if 
you study hard and work hard, if you obey the law and contribute 
something to your community, you will be rewarded by your country.  
You can build a future from you own dreams. 
	     
	     That has always been the promise of America.  Together 
that's what this summer of challenge needs to be:  a reaffirmation of 
the promise of America for so many young people to whom that promise 
has been an illusion.  We can make it a reality.
	     
	     Thank you very much.  (Applause.)

	It seems radio reports were overly optimistic.  All Clinton wants to
cut is $2.5 Billion for community block grants, keeping in summer jobs.

I'm not sure why you don't consider it an option.  No one suggests that
such analysis should be left to "regulators."  In fact, the "re-inventing
government" movement provides just such a cost/benefit approach to the
analysis of public spending.  Libertarians would do well to learn more
about it.

Sorry, but it strikes me that it is the only "feasible" approach.  What is
not feasible is a wholesale attack on all government regulation and 
licensing that treats cutting hair and practicing medicine as equivalent
tasks.

Actually, the only areas of public spending above that strike me as 
generating substantial support among libertarians are police and defense.
(It is an interesting aside that as committed as libertarians claim to
be to a principle of non-coercion, the only areas of public spending
that they frequently support involve hiring people with guns....hmmm...)

Perhaps you have.  May I suggest that you consider that revolutionaries
frequently generate support by acting as protectors of "geezers," 
mothers and children.  Governments that ignore such people on the grounds
that "we don't have much to fear" from them do so at their own peril.

   If I read you right, you're saying in essence that, with a larger
   economy, nations will have more discretionary funds to *waste* on a
   lunar facility. That was certainly partially the case with Apollo,
   but real Lunar colonies will probably require a continuing
   military, scientific, or commercial reason for being rather than
   just a "we have the money, why not?" approach.

Ah, but the whole point is that money spent on a lunar base is not
wasted on the moon. It's not like they'd be using $1000 (1000R?) bills
to fuel their moon-dozers. The money to fund a lunar base would be
spent in the country to which the base belonged. It's a way of funding
high-tech research, just like DARPA was a good excuse to fund various
fields of research, under the pretense that it was crucial to the
defense of the country, or like ESPRIT is a good excuse for the EC to
fund research, under the pretense that it's good for pan-European
cooperation.

Now maybe you think that government-funded research is a waste of
money (in fact, I'm pretty sure you do), but it does count as
investment spending, which does boost the economy (and just look at
the size of that multiplier :->).

>[...]  Any stories on how you all learned?

I'll tell you my story as an example of what *not* to do.

Early in 1984 I took some riding lessons from my college roommate on
his old Honda CB360T.  He had taken the MSF beginner's course, so I
actually learned *some* of what I needed to know to ride.

I proceeded to buy a beat-up Honda CL350 for $400 and a $12 helmet and
rode around wearing this and a cotton windbreaker.  Then I decided to
invest in a full-face helmet (first smart move).  Sometime around then
I also passed my road test.

On May 4, 1984, I got caught in a rainstorm on my way home from a
4-mile trip.  Entering the town where I lived (a rather urban suburb),
I had to stop suddenly for a red light that I noticed too late,
skidded the rear tire out, and was ejected face upward into the
oncoming lane of traffic.  Fortunately for me the oncoming traffic was
also stopped for the same red light, otherwise I might have slid under
a car and been killed.

Now this is anecdotal evidence, to be sure, but I later took the
Experienced Rider Course from the MSF and saw that earlier training
could have helped me greatly.  In your case the need is even greater
since you have nobody to help you practice even the most basic stuff
as I did.

So my advice is to take the MSF beginner's course first thing.  I
wouldn't even buy a bike until you've taken the course, unless you
happen to pick up a real good deal and can store it someplace until
you're ready to use it.

>1)  I only have about $1200-1300 to work with, so that would have 
>to cover everything (bike, helmet, anything else that I'm too 
>ignorant to know I need to buy)

While you're waiting to take the course (it might take a few weeks in
DC, as I recall there were always waiting lists in Boston), could you
save up some more money to start out right?  Say $300 for riding gear,
plus the cost bike, plus maybe $100 (guess) to a mechanic to make sure
the machine is safe (assuming you economize by buying some old beat-up
machine from a private individual), plus insurance, plus registration
and licensing fees, plus the course, you're looking at maybe $600 not
including the bike itself and a reserve for ongoing maintenance.

>2)  What is buying a bike going to do to my insurance?  I turn 18 in 
>about a month so my parents have been taking care of my insurance up
>till now, and I need a comprehensive list of costs that buying a

>a difference)

I pay about $100 insurance now (upstate NY) but it was closer to $200
in Boston (more urban) for decent insurance including substantial
coverage for liability, which you want unless you plan always to be
poor.  I'd guess DC is more like Boston than like a rural area, ergo
more expensive.

>3)  Any recommendations on what I should buy/where I should look for it?

There used to be annual buyer's guides in the usual motorcycle
magazines; I found those helpful in getting an idea of what new or
recent models might be available.  You could probably look through
past issues to size up what used bikes might be available.  (My first
bike was 13 years old when I bought it so I went on my friend's advice
instead.)  Also look at the bikes that you see people riding or that
are parked on the street.  I basically settled on my present bike by
noticing that there were a lot of high-mileage BMW's running around
and they were generally set up the way I wanted.

Nothing wrong with talking to various dealers in your area or visiting
showrooms.  Dealers in the Boston area, at least when I was shopping,
were very nice about letting you look around their showrooms and
quoting prices for bikes that weren't the latest models (hence
cheaper), although I ended up buying both bikes in private sales.

Glad to see that you agree that the current Government is reticent

I demanded that the DA prove such jurisdiction on the record, and the
DA stood mute.  I have also had an appellate court uphold such action
and hide behind California Rules of Court, Rule 106 ("The judges of

Wait a minute.  I agree with you that people have to take responsibility
for their own behavior (I assume that's what you meant by the word
"account"), but also for "the behavior of their immediate community"?

First of all, how "immediate" are you talking about, and secondly, I
have a lot of trouble with any theory of social behavior or justice
which charges anyone with the duty of taking responsibility for or
accounting for the actions of a different person...

If raw materials where to cost enough that getting them from space would

Hi, I just have a small question about my bike. 
Being a fairly experienced BMW and MZ-Mechanic, I just don't know what to 
think about my Honda. 
She was using too much oil for the last 5000 km (on my trip to Daytona bike 
week this spring), and all of a sudden, she trailed smoke like hell and 
was running only on one cylinder. 
I towed the bike home and took it apart, but everything looks in perfect 
working order. No cracks in the heads or pistons, the cylinder walls look 
very clean, and the wear of pistons and cylinders is not measurable. All 
still within factory specs. The only thing I could find, however, was a 
slightly bigger ring gap on the right cylinder (the one with the problem), 
but it is still way below the wear-limit given in the Clymer-manual for 
this bike. 
Any syggestions??? What else could cause my problem??? Do I have to hone 
the cylinder walls (make them a little rougher in a criss-cross-pattern) in 
order to get better breaking in of my new rings??? Won't that increase the 
wear of my pistons??
Please send comments to

The actual hourglass is hollow and is designed to generate a draft,
exploiting the venturi effect.  Around the base of the hourglass is a
ring of water towers.  Warm river water, coming from the steam condenser
in the plant, is sprayed over louvres.  The draft being pulled through
the tower cools the water by both evaporation and convection.  The
sensible heat extracted from the cooling water is the driving force for
draft generation.

It should be noted that the hourglass-shaped cooling towers are used on
both fossile and nuclear plants.  It should also be noted that at 
locations where water is plentiful, the cooling towers are only used part
time, when the discharge temperature would exceed some release limit.
It was once thought that the warm discharge water was damaging to fish.
Fishermen know that is thoroughly incorrect.  Nontheless, stringent,
usually state, regulations remain in some instances.  Since it typically
takes 60,000 hp worth of pumping to move the volume of water needed 
to cool a 1000 MWe plant, the cost of using the towers is not insignificant.

Some survey conducted by the U.S. government and some group (I don't know 
which) did what they were calling on all the news shows this morning, "The most
comprehensive survey of sexuality in the past 50 years".  Not an exact quote,

This low percentage is merely one more in a ton of evidence disproving the 10%

With the continuin talk about the "End of the Space Age" and complaints

Announce that a reward of $1 billion would go to the first corporation

Then you'd see some of the inexpensive but not popular technologies begin 
to be developed. THere'd be a different kind of space race then!

I thought I posted this last year.

The women came to court with three witnesses; the two women that were in
the car and one neighbor that heard me shouting.  My lawyer didn't like
the odds since there were multiple complaints both ways and the judge had
a history of finding everyone guilty of at least something, so he convinced
us (she came without a lawyer) to drop everything.  The net result was
a $500 laywer bill for me and $35 court costs for her.

The only consolation was that she had trouble scraping together the $35
while $500 is not quite one week's beer money for me...

    For discussion purposes, I will ignore dynamic effects like pulses
in the exhaust pipe, and try to paint a useful mental picture.

1.  Unless an engine is supercharged, the pressure available to force
air into the intake tract is _atmospheric_.  At the time the intake
valve is opened, the pressure differential available to move air is only
the difference between the combustion chamber pressure (left over after
the exhaust stroke) and atmospheric.  As the piston decends on the
intake stroke, combustion chamber pressure is decreased, allowing
atmospheric pressure to move more air into the intake tract.  At no time
does the pressure ever become "negative", or even approach a good
vacuum.

2.  At the time of the exhaust valve closing, the pressure in the
combustion chamber is essentially the pressure of the exhaust system up
to the first major flow restriction (the muffler).  Note that the volume
of gas that must flow through the exhaust is much larger than the volume
that must flow through the intake, because of the temperature
difference and the products of combustion.

3.  In the last 6-8 years, the Japanese manufacturers have started
paying attention to exhaust and intake tuning, in pursuit of almighty
horsepower.  At this point in time, on high-performance bikes,
substitution of an aftermarket free-flow air filter will have almost
zero affect on performance, because the stock intake system flows very
well anyway.  Substitution of an aftermarket exhaust system will make
very little difference, unless (in general) the new exhaust system is
_much_ louder than the stocker.

4.  On older bikes,  exhaust back-pressure was the dominating factor.
If free-flowing air filters were substituted, very little difference
was noted, unless a free-flowing exhaust system was installed as well.

5.  In general, an engine can be visualized as an air pump.  At any
given RPM, anything that will cause the engine to pump more air, be it
on the intake or exhaust side, will cause it to produce more horsepower.
Pumping more air will require recalibration (rejetting) of the carburetor.

What evidence are you aware of. What was reported in the media, or all of
the evidence that was presented at the trial.

This sounds to me a lot like the first Rodney King 5 trial. A bunch of people
who saw 10 to 15 seconds out of a several minute long video, decided that
they knew more than people who had sat through a two week trial.

Beleive it or not:  NY state once considered eliminating tolls for motor-
cycles based simply on the fact that motos clog up toll booths.  But then
Mario realized the foolishness of trading a few hundred K $`s a year for
some relief in traffic congestion.

Too bad he won`t take that Sumpreme Court Justice job - I thought we might
be rid of him forever.

I can only say that those people are wrong. The word harass means to 
irritate or torment persistently; I'd hardly consider one time to fall
under the definition of persistent.  Additionally, there is no basis
to assume the behaviour is unwanted, unlike an illegal proposition.

I was speaking from a legalistic viewpoint.  What you say is true, but
the law, in order to make what little sense it manages to make, has to
make *some* assumptions.  Assuming that an illegal activity is unwanted
by the average citizen I think is reasonable.  Certainly, I would need
a preponderance of evidence on the side of the propositioner that there
was a reasonable belief that the proposition was welcome.

The number of people who participate in "victimless" crimes notwithstanding,
the fact reamins that under the law, the activity is illegal.  To presume
that the proposition *is* welcome simply because a large number of people
indulge in it is the type of sophistry only a lawyer could indulge in
with a straight face.

Good thing i stuck in a couple of question marks up there.

I seem to recall, somebody built  or at least proposed a wasp waisetd
Passenger civil transport.  I thought it was a 727,  but maybe it
was a DC- 8,9???   Sure it had a funny passenger compartment,
but on the other hand  it seemed to save fuel.

I thought Area rules  applied even before transonic speeds,  just
not as badly.

Does anyone know if a source for the TCM3105 modem chips (as used in the
Baycom and my PMP modems)?  Ideally, something that is geared toward 
hobbyists:  small quantity, mail order, etc.

For years, we've been buying them from a distributor (Marshall) by the
hundreds for PMP kits.  But orders have dropped to the point where we can
no longer afford to offer this service.  And all of the distributors I've
checked have some crazy minimum order ($100, or so).

I'd like to find a source for those still interested in building PMP kits.
Any suggestions?

                  RADIO ADDRESS TO THE NATION 
                        BY THE PRESIDENT
             
                Pittsburgh International Airport
                    Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania
             
             
10:06 A.M. EDT
             
             
             THE PRESIDENT:  Good morning.  My voice is coming to
you this morning through the facilities of the oldest radio
station in America, KDKA in Pittsburgh.  I'm visiting the city to
meet personally with citizens here to discuss my plans for jobs,
health care and the economy.  But I wanted first to do my weekly
broadcast with the American people. 
             
             I'm told this station first broadcast in 1920 when
it reported that year's presidential elections.  Over the past
seven decades presidents have found ways to keep in touch with
the people, from whistle-stop tours to fire-side chats to the bus
tour that I adopted, along with Vice President Gore, in last
year's campaign.
             
             Every Saturday morning I take this time to talk with
you, my fellow Americans, about the problems on your minds and
what I'm doing to try and solve them.  It's my way of reporting
to you and of giving you a way to hold me accountable.
             
             You sent me to Washington to get our government and
economy moving after years of paralysis and policy and a bad
experiment with trickle-down economics.  You know how important
it is for us to make bold, comprehensive changes in the way we do
business.  
             
             We live in a competitive global economy.  Nations
rise and fall on the skills of their workers, the competitiveness
of their companies, the imagination of their industries, and the
cooperative experience and spirit that exists between business,
labor and government.  Although many of the economies of the
industrialized world are now suffering from slow growth, they've
made many of the smart investments and the tough choices which
our government has for too long ignored.  That's why many of them
have been moving ahead and too many of our people have been
falling behind.
             
             We have an economy today that even when it grows is
not producing new jobs.  We've increased the debt of our nation
by four times over the last 12 years, and we don't have much to
show for it.  We know that wages of most working people have
stopped rising, that most people are working longer work weeks
and that too many families can no longer afford the escalating
cost of health care.
             
             But we also know that, given the right tools, the
right incentives and the right encouragement, our workers and
businesses can make the kinds of products and profits our economy
needs to expand opportunity and to make our communities better
places to live.
             
             In many critical products today Americans are the
low cost, high quality producers.  Our task is to make sure that
we create more of those kinds of jobs.
             
             Just two months ago I gave Congress my plan for
long-term jobs and economic growth.  It changes the old
priorities in Washington and puts our emphasis where it needs to
be -- on people's real needs, on increasing investments and jobs
and education, on cutting the federal deficit, on stopping the
waste which pays no dividends, and redirecting our precious
resources toward investment that creates jobs now and lays the
groundwork for robust economic growth in the future.
             
             These new directions passed the Congress in record
time and created a new sense of hope and opportunity in our
country.  Then the jobs plan I presented to Congress, which would
create hundreds of thousands of jobs, most of them in the private
sector in 1993 and 1994, passed the House of Representatives.  It
now has the support of a majority of the United States Senate. 
But it's been held up by a filibuster of a minority in the
Senate, just 43 senators.  They blocked a vote that they know
would result in the passage of our bill and the creation of jobs.
             
             The issue isn't politics; the issue is people. 
Millions of Americans are waiting for this legislation and
counting on it, counting on us in Washington.  But the jobs bill
has been grounded by gridlock.  
             
             I know the American people are tired of business as
usual and politics as usual.  I know they don't want us to spin
or wheels.  They want the recovery to get moving.  So I have
taken a first step to break this gridlock and gone the extra
mile.  Yesterday I offered to cut the size of this plan by 25
percent -- from $16 billion to $12 billion.  
             
             It's not what I'd hoped for.  With 16 million
Americans looking for full-time work, I simply can't let the bill
languish when I know that even a compromise bill will mean
hundreds of thousands of jobs for our people.  The mandate is to
act to achieve change and move the country forward.  By taking
this initiative in the face of an unrelenting Senate talkathon, I
think we can respond to your mandate and achieve a significant
portion of our original goals.
             
             First, we want to keep the programs as much as
possible that are needed to generate jobs and meet human needs,
including highway and road construction, summer jobs for young
people, immunization for children, construction of waste water
sites, and aid to small businesses.  We also want to keep funding
for extended unemployment compensation benefits, for people who
have been unemployed for a long time because the economy isn't
creating jobs.
             
             Second, I've recommended that all the other programs
in the bill be cut across-the-board by a little more than 40
percent.
             
             And third, I've recommended a new element in this
program to help us immediately start our attempt to fight against
crime by providing $200 million for cities and towns to rehire
police officers who lost their jobs during the recession and put
them back to work protecting our people.  I'm also going to fight
for a tough crime bill because the people of this country need it
and deserve it.
             
             Now, the people who are filibustering this bill --
the Republican senators -- say they won't vote for it because it
increases deficit spending, because there's extra spending this
year that hasn't already been approved.  That sounds reasonable,
doesn't it?  Here's what they don't say.  This program is more
than paid for by budget cuts over my five-year budget, and this
budget is well within the spending limits already approved by the
Congress this year.
             
             It's amazing to me that many of these same senators
who are filibustering the bill voted during the previous
administration for billions of dollars of the same kind of
emergency spending, and much of it was not designed to put the
American people to work.  
             
             This is not about deficit spending.  We have offered
a plan to cut the deficit.  This is about where your priorities
are -- on people or on politics.  
             
             Keep in mind that our jobs bill is paid for dollar
for dollar.  It is paid for by budget cuts.  And it's the
soundest investment we can now make for ourselves and our
children.  I urge all Americans to take another look at this jobs
and investment program; to consider again the benefits for all of
us when we've helped make more American partners working to
ensure the future of our nation and the strength of our economy.
             
             You know, if every American who wanted a job had
one, we wouldn't have a lot of the other problems we have in this
country today.  This bill is not a miracle, it's a modest first
step to try to set off a job creation explosion in this country
again.  But it's a step we ought to take.  And it is fully paid
for over the life of our budget.
             
             Tell your lawmakers what you think.  Tell them how
important the bill is.  If it passes, we'll all be winners.
             
             Good morning, and thank you for listening.

                               END                 10:11 A.M. EDT

Another dodge.  Oh well.  I'm no match for your amazing repertoire
of red herrings and smoke screens.  

You asked for an apology.  I'm not going to apologize for pointing out
that your straw-man argument was a straw-man argument.  Nor for saying

scholarship that it should be an embarrassment to anti-inerrantists,

for pointing out that "they do it too" is not an excuse. Nor for calling
your red herrings and smoke screens what they are.

I'm still not sure why you think I'm a hypocrite.  It's true that I
haven't responded to any of Robert Weiss' articles, which may be due in
part to the fact that I almost never read his articles.  But I have
responded to both you and Frank DeCenso (a fundie/inerrantist.)  Both
you and Frank have taken quotes out of context, and I've objected to
both of you doing so.  I've criticized bad arguments both when they
were yours and I agreed with the conclusion (that the Bible is not
inerrant), and when they were Frank's and I disagreed with the
conclusion.  I've criticized both you and Frank for evading questions,
and for trying to "explain me away" without addressing the objections
I raise (you by accusing me of being hypocritical and irrational, Frank
by accusing me of being motivated by a desire to attack the Bible.) I
don't see that any of this is hypocritical, nor do I apologize for it.

I do apologize, however, for having offended you in any other way.

Hum, I guess this has some significance as opposed to having an incredible
drop during the last days in office. Unfortuantely having a loss in the
polls during the last days of office usually means no re-election. Ask

And how did the "free love advocates of the 1960's" manage to perform

Now let me get this straight.  After a nice, long rant about how
people need to take personal responsibility for their economic and
social lives, all of a sudden 1960's radicals (such as me, I guess)
are responsible for poor people's lifestyles?  Tell me how that
works--or do you think that poor people are just too dumb to think
for themselves?

There are many reasons for the disintegration of the family and
support systems in general among this nation's poor.  Somehow I
don't think Murphy Brown--or Janis Joplin--is at the top of any 
sane person's list.

You want to go after my generation's vaunted cultural revolution for

Sorry, but I don't see how the response applies to what was posted.

Unless I am badly mistaken, Rohit is suggesting that protecting boys
from men is different than protecting girls from men. There are situations
in which boys and girls are apart from members of the *opposite* sex
(due to social convention or whatever) and thus are safe (in at least
some sense). These same situations don't (necessarily) protect the
children from abuse by members of the *same* sex.

If we can understand that, it's not such a tremendous leap to suggest
that if we all think about it hard, *someone* may come up with a
practical solution (or even a partial solution) to some of the situations
in which children are made vulnerable to homosexuals who wish to abuse
them. By working together "with good will on both sides", we may be
able to start solving problems without restricting anyone's freedoms.

Mr. Walz on the other hand is using Rohit's post as an excuse for
personal attacks on Mr. Cramer. While Mr. Walz hasn't (by a *long*
stretch) been the only one to flame Mr. Cramer, it is no less childish
and it only serves to weaken any other arguments he may make in the
future.

Once again, Mark, you don't specify the means through which the government
is to be prevented from becoming the tool of business interests.  As a 
left-wing, big government, conventional liberal, I'm just as willing as
you are to vote against anti-competitive regulations that favor auto
dealers.  

But what I hear from libertarians is a desire to limit incumbents' terms,
to weaken government by eliminating its power to enforce antitrust laws,
and a desire to eliminate legislator's pay.  Each strikes me as a 
particularly ineffective way to insure that auto dealers and other special
interests cannot influence public policy.  In fact, they seem clearly
designed to accomplish the opposite.

This is similar to my saying that Clinton's timber summit does little to
fix the health care problem.  Look at the whole picture, not just
randomly picked libertarian positions.  If government is not allowed to
use "non-initiated force" to achieve its goals, than no special interest
can influence the government to use non-initiated force on their behalf.

The means to reaching such a restricted government is another topic
which I'll address briefly.  It certainly won't happen until
libertarianism is the dominate philosophy.  What means do we have to
make libertarianism the dominate philosophy?  Statists run the education
monopoly, so we have to be creative.  The Advocates for Self-Government
reports 85% of their Seminar 1 participants "embrace" libertarianism.
That's the best means I've seen yet.  We should lobby for compulsory
Seminar 1 attendance. :) [in jest!]

Nope, you're confusing separate programs.  Atlas was the first-generation

Titan launchers are based on, was the third-generation heavy ICBM.  There
was essentially nothing in common between these three programs.

(Yes, *three* programs.  Despite the similarity of names, Titan I and
Titan II were completely different missiles.  They didn't even use the

Sorry, the Titan silos (a) can't handle the Titan launchers with their

violations of normal range-safety rules (nobody cares about such things
in the event of a nuclear war, but in peacetime they matter), and (c) were

You totally forgot the original post that you posted Allen. In that post

Of course there is a fee. It is for administration. Geez Allen any
organization has costs but there is a heck of a difference in  legitimate
costs, such as libraries and other things that must be there to support
a program and "wrap" as you originally stated it.You stated that wrap
was on top of all of the overhead which a couple of sentences down you
say is not true. Which is it Allen?

As you have posted on this subject Allen, you state that wrap is over and
above overhead and is a seperate charge. You admit here that this is wrong.
Nasa has a line item budget every year. I have seen it Allen. Get some
numbers from that detailed NASA budget and dig out the wrap numbers and then
howl to high heaven about it. Until you do that you are barking in the wind.

Integration could be done better at the centers. Apollo integration was 
done here at Msfc and that did not turn out so bad. The philosophy of
Reston is totally wrong Allen. There you have a bunch of people who are
completely removed from the work that they are trying to oversee. There
is no way that will ever work. It has never worked in any large scale project
that it was ever tried on. Could you imagine a Reston like set up for 
Apollo?

Oh you are full of it Allen on this one. I agree that JSC screwed up big.
They should be responsible for that screw up and the people that caused it
replaced. To make a stupid statement like that just shows how deep your
bias goes. Come to MSFC for a couple of weeks and you will find out just
how wrong you really are. Maybe not, people like you believe exactly what
they want to believe no matter  what the facts are contrary to it.

I agree that integration is the single most important part of a  successful
large scale effort. What I completly disagree with is seperating that
integration function from  the people that are doing the work. It is called
leadership Allen. That is what made Apollo work. Final responsibility for
the success of Apollo was held by less than 50 people. That is leadership
and responsibility. There is neither when you have any organization set up
as Reston is. You could take the same people and move them to JSC or MSFC
and they could do a much better job. Why did it take a year for Reston to
finally say something about the problem? If they were on site and part of the
process then the problem would have never gotten out of hand in the first place.

There is one heck of a lot I do not know Allen, but one thing I do know is that
for a project to be successful you must have leadership. I remember all of the
turn over at Reston that kept SSF program in shambles for years do you? It is
lack of responsibility and leadership that is the programs problem. Lack of
leadership from the White House, Congress and at Reston. Nasa is only a
symptom of a greater national problem. You are so narrowly focused in your
efforts that you do not see this.

I have the time to reitereate one more timet that if the leadership that is
at reston was on site at JSC the problem never would have happened, totally
ignoring the lack of leadership of congress. This many headed hydra that
has grown up at NASA is the true problem of the Agency and to try to 
change the question to suit you and your bias is only indicative of
your position.

Jesus also recognized other holy days, like the Passover.  Acts 15 says 
that no more should be layed on the Gentiles than that which is necessary.
The sabbath is not in the list, nor do any of the epistles instruct people
to keep the 7th day, while Christians were living among people who did not
keep the 7th day.  It looks like that would have been a problem.

Instead, we have Scriptures telling us that all days can be esteemed alike
(Romans 14:5) and that no man should judge us in regard to what kind of
food we eat, Jewish holy days we keep, or _in regard to the sabbath. (Col. 2.)

>The

I don't think that the Sabbath, or any other command of the law is totally
irrelevant to modern Christians, but what about Collosions 2, where it says
that we are not to be judged in regard to the keeping of the sabbath?

Hell! This is WARM. I retired my fleece from under the Aerostich last 
month when the temperature got aboce 40. Try living a couple of years 
on the dole, so you cant afford any heating. You put the gear on in
October, abd you take it off again in May. Getting out on the bike 
seems like a luxury in comparison cos oyur usuallu going somewhere 
warm.

Several years back one of the radar detectors manufacturers, in
defiance to Virginia's law against radar detectors, passed out
thousands of fake cardboard radar detectors at truck stops near
the Virginia State lines.  At that time there were no radar
detector Detectors!  I am not sure of the impact but I would
imagine that enforcement of the law by visually sighting a
radar detector became difficult - if not impossible!

As I said earlier, efforts to throw out or eliminate the VA law
against radar detectors has been in vain.  In fact, effective
Jan. 1, 1993, the fine for possession of a radar detector
accessable to the driver of a vehicle in VA is now $250.00.  

I have noted an interesting anomality with my Alinco DR-100 2
meter ham transceiver.... It will make a *cheap* radar detector
scream!  I am not sure of the range, but it is obvious by the
brake lights that it can be at least 50 feet at 50 watts! :-)

Yes, this is certainly one of the traditional ideas about the Mithraic
cult (although not the only one.)  It had many elements that seem
to have been borrowed by Catholicism (e.g. the Mass, communion, the
sharing of a sacred meal, consecration of bread and wine, etc.)

For quite an amusing novel that uses this same idea, check out:

The Covenant of the Flame
by David Morrell.

It has some quite interesting occult bits, and lots of killing.
I won't spoil it by revealing the ending, but I will say that it
is relevant to Mithraism.

AllThe Devil ReincarnateSWR meter for CB radios

TD>From: ssave@ole.cdac.com (The Devil Reincarnate)
TD>Organization: CDAC, WA
TD>What
TD>is a good choice for a CB? 1/4 or 1/8 wave?
TD>  I read the installation instructions on a 1/4 wave antenna,
TD>and they suggested that I use an SWR to tune it at channel 12

The best antenna is one that will let out the most wave (probably not the 
best explanation, but the rest makes sense) A one wave will cancell itself 
out (BTW no such beastie) . The best is a 1/2 wave antenna, followed by 
1/4, then 1/8 etc.

As for SWRing in, what you actually do is trim the antenna to the correct 
length for the specific wavelength you will be transmitting on. Since the 
wavelength varies with the channel you use, then it's recommended to SWR 
in using the middle channel of those you are going to use.
Anyway in the beginning of CB's, all new antennas had to be SWR'ed in, 
nowdays manufactures trim the antennas almost spot on, so that there's not 
much point in SWRing. Then again you may be a fanatic and whish to do it 
anyway.

Here is a press release from the Reserve Officers Association.

 Reserve Officers Say Demographics Ignored in Nominations to
Close Naval, Marine Reserve Centers
 To: National Desk, Defense Writer
 Contact: Herbert M. Hart of the Reserve Officers Association of
          the United States, 202-479-2258

   WASHINGTON, April 13 /U.S. Newswire/ -- The Reserve Officers
Association of the United States has alerted the Defense Base
Realignment and Closure Commission that the services failed to give
sufficient weight to demographics in recommendations made to close
56 Naval and Marine Corps Reserve centers.
   In letters to the closure commission and to all 86 members of
Congress with affected locations in their constituencies, including
Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, ROA charged that the developers of the Navy-Marine list
ignored demographics of the civilian population, particularly prior
service personnel.
   ROA's executive director, Maj. Gen. Evan L. Hultman, AUS (Ret.),
suggested "concern that the only plausible alternative is that they
are intentionally attempting to foreclose the Naval Reserve
components from maintaining even today's relatively low level of
participation in their parent service's Total Force of the future."
   He asked the commission "to remove from consideration all
locations without sufficient and convincing demographic data to
warrant approval of the requested action."
   "Only a few of the 56 Naval and Marine Corps Reserve
installations on this list are large enough to have a significant
impact on the community, if closed," wrote Hultman.  "The major
issue is the cumulative impact of moving or closing such a large
percentage of the existing locations."
   Hultman reminded the commission, "The fact that the vast
majority of the Reserve installations on this list do not come
close to meeting the minimal requirements for consideration in this
process certainly supports the thesis" that these actions are
simply an attempt to foreclose a substantial role for the Navy and
Marine Corps Reserve.
   ROA also noted "that at the end of the 1960s, when the number of
Naval Reservists was approximately the same as today, there were 480
Naval Reserve facilities.  If the Navy recommendations are
approved, there will be less than 200 Naval Reserve facilities."
   Facilities on the list include seven Naval Air Stations ranging
from South Weymouth, Mass., to Alameda, Calif., 28 Naval
Reserve Centers in Macon, Ga., and Parkersburg, W.Va., to
Missoula and Great Falls. Mont.  Naval/Marine Corps Reserve
Centers include four in San Francisco, Fort Wayne, Ind.,
Billings, Mont., and Abilene, Texas.
   A major Marine Reserve Center on the list is that at El
Toro, Calif., plus six others.

If I read you right, you're saying in essence that, with a larger
economy, nations will have more discretionary funds to *waste*
on a lunar facility. That was certainly partially the case with Apollo, 
but real Lunar colonies will probably require a continuing military,
scientific, or commercial reason for being rather than just a "we have 
the money, why not?" approach.

It's conceivable that Luna will have a military purpose, it's possible
that Luna will have a commercial purpose, but it's most likely that
Luna will only have a scientific purpose for the next several hundred
years at least. Therefore, Lunar bases should be predicated on funding
levels little different from those found for Antarctic bases. Can you
put a 200 person base on the Moon for $30 million a year? Even if you
use grad students?

/(emery)
/The one single historic event that has had the biggest impact on the

This is hardly possible, as the majority of people in the world were
born, lived their life, and died, without ever knowing anything about
Christ.  The majority of the rest of the world have decided that he 
is not who Emery thinks he is.



/(emery)
/Why were the writers of the New Testament documents so convinced that
/Jesus really did rise from the dead?
/We have four gospel accounts.  

I am leaving out all "proofs" of Emery's which rely on quoting the
bible as proof.  Circular reasoning, etc.  There have been occasions
already stated many times for later generations of Xtians to change,
edit, or otherwise alter the bible to fit their political gospel.
And if we accept the bible as true just because the bible says it
is true, then (to be fair) we have to do the same to the Bhagavad-Gita
and the Koran, both of which contradict the bible.

Enough said.



/(emery)
/Yet we have no reason to believe these disciples to be immoral and dishonest.
/We have no historic information that would lead us to the conclusion that
/these people were not God-fearing people who sincerely and whole-heartedly
/believed that the resurrection of their Lord Jesus was a real event.
/And for what gain would they lie?  To make a stand at that time meant 
/persecution, imprisonment, and perhaps even death.

Again, this is only the biblical account and there is no independent proof
of any of this happening.  It just isn't there.

Besides, simply being sincere or willing to die for your faith does not
make your faith correct.  There are Muslims dying in Bosnia right now;
does the fact that they are willing to die for Islam mean that Islam is
the correct religion?




(emery)
/History bears out the persecution of Christians.  Roman historian, Cornelius 
/Tacitus, Govenor of Asia, in A.D. 112, writing of Nero's reign, alluded to 
/the torture of Christians in Rome:


All you have proven is that these people were tortured for their faith.  That
does not prove that their faith is true or correct; it just means that they
were sincere in their beliefs. 

Being willing to die for what you believe doesn't make your belief the truth.
It's not that easy.  And minority religions have always suffered torture;
Muslims suffer torture and harassment in India and Bosnia today.  All religions
are harassed in China today.  You haven't proven anything so far.



/(emery)
/With all the suffering and persecution that it meant to be a believer, it
/would be quite probable that at least one of those in the supposed conspiracy
/would come forward and confess that the whole thing was a big hoax.  

Not if they didn't believe that it was a hoax.  


/(emery)
/Yet not one did.  It seems rather reasonable that the disciples did not make
/up the resurrection but sincerely believed that Jesus had actually risen
/from the dead; especially in light of the sufferings that came upon those
/who believed.

The followers of Muhammad firmly believed in the miracles that the Koran
says Muhammad performed.  They were attacked and slaughtered for their
beliefs.  They didn't denounce Muhammad or Islam.  If you are correct,
then that means Islam is the true faith.

You see how stupid your proofs are?

What suburban kid would want to hold down a minimum wage job when there is so

Yet, somehow, surburban kids do hold down minimum wage jobs.  So do inner

The Proton has been used in 2, 3, and 4 stage versions.  The two stage version
was used for the first 3 launches, while the 3 and 4 stage versions are used
today.  The four stage version is used mostly for escape (and geosynchronous?)
orbits, while the 3 stage version is used for low earth orbits.  Since this is
the version that launched Mir and the Salyuts (and the add-on modules for Mir),
as long as Centaur is smaller than Mir (which I believe it is), it should fit
under the shroud.

I vaguely recall that the Russians are developing a LH2/LOX upper stage for the
Proton.

The Federal Communications Act of 1934 made it *legal* for you to

X, K, and Ka bands) in the United States.  The Electronic
Communications Privacy Act of 1989(?) restricted the FCA of 1934

on receiving RADAR (or, curiously, cordless phones.)  Enforcement
of the Virginia law is in violation of the FCA of 1934.  If you have

Mark,

  47k is not too many miles on a VFR750.  I sold my (well maintained)
'87 VFR700 with 52k miles on it and the engine was in mint condition.
All that the bike needed was steering head bearings and fork bushings
and seals.  The guy who bought it had a mechanic pull the valve covers
to look at the top end, do a compression check etc.  He confirmed it was
mint.

   As for price, $4500 seems a little steep.  I bought my '90 with 12k
miles on it a year ago (and in absolutely cherry condition) for $4800.
There is a bluebook, ask your bank or credit union for the going price.
I've seen a couple of ads for VFR's in the $4500 dollar range.  They all
said low miles & mint condition but I didn't actually go look at them.

   A VFR is a very sweet bike and will last you forever if you maintain
it at all.  One thing to look for, BTW, is a soft front end.  If my
VFR is any indication, at 12k miles the fork springs were totally shot.
Progressive springs ($55) fixed it right up.

Good luck,

We heard about this from a newspaper article.  Journalists and editors
always pick out the most interesting and sensational "facts" for our
delectation.  As the editor of the Sun once said: "We never let the
facts get in the way of a good story".  You must have noticed how
motorcyclists get treated by the press.  They thrive on hysteria,
ignorance, sensationalism and one-upmanship.  Unfortunately there's
not enough salt to keep taking a pinch of.

    as a point of info, some of the early nuclear power plants in this
country used the fission pile as a first stage to get the water hot, and
then had a second stage -fossil fuel- step to get the water (actually
steam) VERY HOT.

   I remember seeing this at Con Edison's Indian Point #1 power plant,
which is about 30 miles north of NYC, and built more or less 1958.

There have been several books written on gov. waste, network news programs 
from time to time devote segments to this, and there have been bills proposed
that significantly reduces expenditures without touching external programs by 
changing the way 'congress does business' (and make it more efficent).

True, blame is easy, but also is spending someone else's money.  

Clinton ran on a platform that he would '...not raise taxes on the middle class
to pay for these (his) programs'.  He has proposed a program that is not 
specific, that counts on tax hikes to pay for.

My driveway and about half my neighbor's driveways are long enough to
do a good 80 clicks (50mph for the velocity impaired) if we wanted to.
Granted, I live in the country, however I've seen neighbors whip out
of their driveways at the above mentioned 30 mph quite a bit- they
claim they can tell that "There's noone on the road for quite a ways."
This despite having nearly been hit myself by one of them while driving
a Chev 4x4, and twice taking my 10-speed bicycle over the hood of a
car that had pulled out, saw me, *then* stopped.  Same driver.  Same car.
About two months apart.  

ObMoto:  The scary relevant part is that these people and I live on the type
of twisty two lane that we all favor for riding- and I know damn well
that they can't see me on my bike, not if they couldn't see me in 
my pickup.

	What used to peeve me in Canada was the cars with bloody _red_ rear
indicators.  You'd see a single red light come on and think, "Now, is he
stopping but one brake-lamp is not working, or does he have those dumb bloody
_red_ rear indicators?"  This being Survival 101, you have to assume he's
braking and take the appropriate actions, until such time as the light goes
out and on again, after which you can be reasonably certain it's a bloody _red_
rear indicator.

UPCOMING PLANETARY PROBES - MISSIONS AND SCHEDULES

    Information on upcoming or currently active missions not mentioned below
    would be welcome. Sources: NASA fact sheets, Cassini Mission Design
    team, ISAS/NASDA launch schedules, press kits.


    ASUKA (ASTRO-D) - ISAS (Japan) X-ray astronomy satellite, launched into
    Earth orbit on 2/20/93. Equipped with large-area wide-wavelength (1-20
    Angstrom) X-ray telescope, X-ray CCD cameras, and imaging gas
    scintillation proportional counters.


    CASSINI - Saturn orbiter and Titan atmosphere probe. Cassini is a joint
    NASA/ESA project designed to accomplish an exploration of the Saturnian
    system with its Cassini Saturn Orbiter and Huygens Titan Probe. Cassini
    is scheduled for launch aboard a Titan IV/Centaur in October of 1997.
    After gravity assists of Venus, Earth and Jupiter in a VVEJGA
    trajectory, the spacecraft will arrive at Saturn in June of 2004. Upon
    arrival, the Cassini spacecraft performs several maneuvers to achieve an
    orbit around Saturn. Near the end of this initial orbit, the Huygens
    Probe separates from the Orbiter and descends through the atmosphere of
    Titan. The Orbiter relays the Probe data to Earth for about 3 hours
    while the Probe enters and traverses the cloudy atmosphere to the
    surface. After the completion of the Probe mission, the Orbiter
    continues touring the Saturnian system for three and a half years. Titan
    synchronous orbit trajectories will allow about 35 flybys of Titan and
    targeted flybys of Iapetus, Dione and Enceladus. The objectives of the
    mission are threefold: conduct detailed studies of Saturn's atmosphere,
    rings and magnetosphere; conduct close-up studies of Saturn's
    satellites, and characterize Titan's atmosphere and surface.

    One of the most intriguing aspects of Titan is the possibility that its
    surface may be covered in part with lakes of liquid hydrocarbons that
    result from photochemical processes in its upper atmosphere. These
    hydrocarbons condense to form a global smog layer and eventually rain
    down onto the surface. The Cassini orbiter will use onboard radar to
    peer through Titan's clouds and determine if there is liquid on the
    surface. Experiments aboard both the orbiter and the entry probe will
    investigate the chemical processes that produce this unique atmosphere.

    The Cassini mission is named for Jean Dominique Cassini (1625-1712), the
    first director of the Paris Observatory, who discovered several of
    Saturn's satellites and the major division in its rings. The Titan
    atmospheric entry probe is named for the Dutch physicist Christiaan
    Huygens (1629-1695), who discovered Titan and first described the true
    nature of Saturn's rings.

    GALILEO - Jupiter orbiter and atmosphere probe, in transit. Has returned
    the first resolved images of an asteroid, Gaspra, while in transit to
    Jupiter. Efforts to unfurl the stuck High-Gain Antenna (HGA) have
    essentially been abandoned. JPL has developed a backup plan using data
    compression (JPEG-like for images, lossless compression for data from
    the other instruments) which should allow the mission to achieve
    approximately 70% of its original objectives.

    HITEN - Japanese (ISAS) lunar probe launched 1/24/90. Has made
    multiple lunar flybys. Released Hagoromo, a smaller satellite,
    into lunar orbit. This mission made Japan the third nation to
    orbit a satellite around the Moon.


    MAGELLAN - Venus radar mapping mission. Has mapped almost the entire
    surface at high resolution. Currently (4/93) collecting a global gravity
    map.


    MARS OBSERVER - Mars orbiter including 1.5 m/pixel resolution camera.
    Launched 9/25/92 on a Titan III/TOS booster. MO is currently (4/93) in
    transit to Mars, arriving on 8/24/93. Operations will start 11/93 for
    one martian year (687 days).


    TOPEX/Poseidon - Joint US/French Earth observing satellite, launched
    8/10/92 on an Ariane 4 booster. The primary objective of the
    TOPEX/POSEIDON project is to make precise and accurate global
    observations of the sea level for several years, substantially
    increasing understanding of global ocean dynamics. The satellite also
    will increase understanding of how heat is transported in the ocean.


    ULYSSES- European Space Agency probe to study the Sun from an orbit over
    its poles. Launched in late 1990, it carries particles-and-fields
    experiments (such as magnetometer, ion and electron collectors for
    various energy ranges, plasma wave radio receivers, etc.) but no camera.

    Since no human-built rocket is hefty enough to send Ulysses far out of
    the ecliptic plane, it went to Jupiter instead, and stole energy from
    that planet by sliding over Jupiter's north pole in a gravity-assist
    manuver in February 1992. This bent its path into a solar orbit tilted
    about 85 degrees to the ecliptic. It will pass over the Sun's south pole
    in the summer of 1993. Its aphelion is 5.2 AU, and, surprisingly, its
    perihelion is about 1.5 AU-- that's right, a solar-studies spacecraft
    that's always further from the Sun than the Earth is!

    While in Jupiter's neigborhood, Ulysses studied the magnetic and
    radiation environment. For a short summary of these results, see
    *Science*, V. 257, p. 1487-1489 (11 September 1992). For gory technical
    detail, see the many articles in the same issue.


    OTHER SPACE SCIENCE MISSIONS (note: this is based on a posting by Ron
    Baalke in 11/89, with ISAS/NASDA information contributed by Yoshiro
    Yamada (yamada@yscvax.ysc.go.jp). I'm attempting to track changes based
    on updated shuttle manifests; corrections and updates are welcome.

    1993 Missions
	o ALEXIS [spring, Pegasus]
	    ALEXIS (Array of Low-Energy X-ray Imaging Sensors) is to perform
	    a wide-field sky survey in the "soft" (low-energy) X-ray
	    spectrum. It will scan the entire sky every six months to search
	    for variations in soft-X-ray emission from sources such as white
	    dwarfs, cataclysmic variable stars and flare stars. It will also
	    search nearby space for such exotic objects as isolated neutron
	    stars and gamma-ray bursters. ALEXIS is a project of Los Alamos
	    National Laboratory and is primarily a technology development
	    mission that uses astrophysical sources to demonstrate the
	    technology. Contact project investigator Jeffrey J Bloch
	    (jjb@beta.lanl.gov) for more information.

	o Wind [Aug, Delta II rocket]
	    Satellite to measure solar wind input to magnetosphere.

	o Space Radar Lab [Sep, STS-60 SRL-01]
	    Gather radar images of Earth's surface.

	o Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer [Dec, Pegasus rocket]
	    Study of Stratospheric ozone.

	o SFU (Space Flyer Unit) [ISAS]
	    Conducting space experiments and observations and this can be
	    recovered after it conducts the various scientific and
	    engineering experiments. SFU is to be launched by ISAS and
	    retrieved by the U.S. Space Shuttle on STS-68 in 1994.

    1994
	o Polar Auroral Plasma Physics [May, Delta II rocket]
	    June, measure solar wind and ions and gases surrounding the
	    Earth.

	o IML-2 (STS) [NASDA, Jul 1994 IML-02]
	    International Microgravity Laboratory.

	o ADEOS [NASDA]
	    Advanced Earth Observing Satellite.

	o MUSES-B (Mu Space Engineering Satellite-B) [ISAS]
	    Conducting research on the precise mechanism of space structure
	    and in-space astronomical observations of electromagnetic waves.

    1995
	LUNAR-A [ISAS]
	    Elucidating the crust structure and thermal construction of the
	    moon's interior.


    Proposed Missions:
	o Advanced X-ray Astronomy Facility (AXAF)
	    Possible launch from shuttle in 1995, AXAF is a space
	    observatory with a high resolution telescope. It would orbit for
	    15 years and study the mysteries and fate of the universe.

	o Earth Observing System (EOS)
	    Possible launch in 1997, 1 of 6 US orbiting space platforms to
	    provide long-term data (15 years) of Earth systems science
	    including planetary evolution.

	o Mercury Observer
	    Possible 1997 launch.

	o Lunar Observer
	    Possible 1997 launch, would be sent into a long-term lunar
	    orbit. The Observer, from 60 miles above the moon's poles, would
	    survey characteristics to provide a global context for the
	    results from the Apollo program.

	o Space Infrared Telescope Facility
	    Possible launch by shuttle in 1999, this is the 4th element of
	    the Great Observatories program. A free-flying observatory with
	    a lifetime of 5 to 10 years, it would observe new comets and
	    other primitive bodies in the outer solar system, study cosmic
	    birth formation of galaxies, stars and planets and distant
	    infrared-emitting galaxies

	o Mars Rover Sample Return (MRSR)
	    Robotics rover would return samples of Mars' atmosphere and
	    surface to Earch for analysis. Possible launch dates: 1996 for
	    imaging orbiter, 2001 for rover.

	o Fire and Ice
	    Possible launch in 2001, will use a gravity assist flyby of
	    Earth in 2003, and use a final gravity assist from Jupiter in
	    2005, where the probe will split into its Fire and Ice
	    components: The Fire probe will journey into the Sun, taking
	    measurements of our star's upper atmosphere until it is
	    vaporized by the intense heat. The Ice probe will head out
	    towards Pluto, reaching the tiny world for study by 2016.

Look, guy, I doubt anyone here approves of Drunk Driving, but if
he's been caught and convicted and punished maybe you ought to
lighten up? I mean, it isn't like most of us haven't had a few
and then ridden or driven home. *We* just didn't get caught.
And I can speak for myself and say it will *never* happen again,
but that is beside the point.

In answer to the original poster: I'd insure whatever vehicle
is cheapest, and can get you to and from work, and suffer
through it for a few years, til your rates drop.

And *don't* drink and drive. I had one friend killed by a 
drunk, and I was rear ended by one, totaling my bike (bent
frame), and only failing to kill me because I had an eye
on my mirror while I waited at the stoplight.

	Go *real* easy. It's amazing how solid a grip you have on the

	she's going to slide off the back, and "snappy" turns for you are

Sterrenkundig symposium 'Compacte Objecten'
                                             op 26 april 1993


In het jaar 1643, zeven jaar na de oprichting van de
Universiteit van Utrecht, benoemde de universiteit haar
eerste sterrenkundige waarnemer. Hiermee ontstond de tweede
universiteitssterrenwacht ter wereld. Aert Jansz, de eerste
waarnemer, en zijn opvolgers voerden de Utrechtse sterrenkunde
in de daaropvolgende jaren, decennia en eeuwen naar de
voorhoede van het astronomisch onderzoek. Dit jaar is het 350
jaar geleden dat deze historische benoeming plaatsvond.

De huidige generatie Utrechtse sterrenkundigen en studenten
sterrenkunde, verenigd in het Sterrekundig Instituut Utrecht,
vieren de benoeming van hun 'oervader' middels een breed scala
aan feestelijke activiteiten. Zo is er voor scholieren een
planetenproject, programmeert de Studium Generale een aantal
voordrachten met een sterrenkundig thema en wordt op de Dies
Natalis aan een astronoom een eredoctoraat uitgereikt. Er
staat echter meer op stapel.

Studenten natuur- en sterrenkunde kunnen op 26 april aan een
sterrenkundesymposium deelnemen. De onderwerpen van het
symposium zijn opgebouwd rond een van de zwaartepunten van het
huidige Utrechtse onderzoek: het onderzoek aan de zogeheten
'compacte objecten', de eindstadia in de evolutie van sterren.
Bij de samenstelling van het programma is getracht de
deelnemer een zo aktueel en breed mogelijk beeld te geven van
de stand van zaken in het onderzoek aan deze eindstadia. In de
eerste, inleidende lezing zal dagvoorzitter prof. Lamers een
beknopt overzicht geven van de evolutie van zware sterren,
waarna de zeven overige sprekers in lezingen van telkens een
half uur nader op de specifieke evolutionaire eindprodukten
zullen ingaan. Na afloop van elke lezing is er gelegenheid tot
het stellen van vragen. Het dagprogramma staat afgedrukt op
een apart vel.
Het niveau van de lezingen is afgestemd op tweedejaars
studenten natuur- en sterrenkunde. OOK ANDERE BELANGSTELLENDEN
ZIJN VAN HARTE WELKOM!

Tijdens de lezing van prof. Kuijpers zullen, als alles goed
gaat, de veertien radioteleskopen van de Radiosterrenwacht
Westerbork worden ingezet om via een directe verbinding tussen
het heelal, Westerbork en Utrecht het zwakke radiosignaal van
een snel roterende kosmische vuurtoren, een zogeheten pulsar,
in de symposiumzaal door te geven en te audiovisualiseren.
Prof. Kuijpers zal de binnenkomende signalen (elkaar snel
opvolgende scherp gepiekte pulsen radiostraling) bespreken en
trachten te verklaren.
Het slagen van dit unieke experiment staat en valt met de
technische haalbaarheid ervan. De op te vangen signalen zijn
namelijk zo zwak, dat pas na een waarnemingsperiode van 10
miljoen jaar genoeg energie is opgevangen om een lamp van 30
Watt een seconde te laten branden! Tijdens het symposium zal

As I won't be able to make the Joust this summer (Job related time 
conflict :'^{   ), I plan instead on going to the Rider Rally in 
Knoxville.

I'll be leaving from Chicago. and generally plan on going down along
the Indiana/Illinois border into Kentucky and then Tennessee.  I would 
be very interested in hearing suggestions of roads/routes/areas that 
you would consider "must ride" while on the way to Knoxville.

I can leave as early as 5/22 and need to arrive in Knoxville by 6PM
on 5/25.  That leaves me a pretty good stretch of time to explore on 
the way.

By the way if anyone else is going, and would like to partner for the 
ride down, let me know.  I'll be heading east afterward to visit family, 
but sure don't mind company on the ride down to the Rally.  Depending on 
weather et al. my plan is motelling/tenting thru the trip.

From the Rally I'll be heading up the Blue Ridge Parkway, then jogging
into West Va (I-77) to run up 219 -> Marlington, 28 -> Petersburg, 
55E -> I-81/I-66E.  After this point the route is presently undetermined
into Pennsylvania, New York?, and back to Chicago (by 6/6).  Suggestions 
for these areas would be of great interest also.

Many thanks for your ideas,

Enjoy,

My previous posting on dog attacks must have generated some bad karma or
something. I've weathered attempted dog attacks before using the
approved method: Slow down to screw up dog's triangulation of target,
then take off and laugh at the dog, now far behind you. This time, it
didn't work because I didn't have time. Riding up the hill leading to my
house, I encountered a liver-and-white Springer Spaniel (no relation to
the Springer Softail, or the Springer Spagthorpe, a close relation to
the Spagthorpe Viking). Actually, the dog encountered me with intent to
harm.

But I digress: I was riding near the (unpainted) centerline of the
roughly 30-foot wide road, doing between forty and sixty clicks (30 mph
for the velocity-impaired). The dog shot at me from behind bushes on the
left side of the road at an impossibly high speed. I later learned he
had been accelerating from the front porch, about thirty feet away,
heading down the very gently sloped approach to the side of the road. I
saw the dog, and before you could say SIPDE, he was on me. Boom! I took
the dog in the left leg, and from the marks on the bike my leg was
driven up the side of the bike with considerable force, making permanent
marks on the plastic parts of the bike, and cracking one panel. I think
I saw the dog spin around when I looked back, but my memory of this
moment is hazy.

I next turned around, and picked the most likely looking house. The
apologetic woman explained that the dog was not seriously hurt (cut
mouth) and hoped I was not hurt either. I could feel the pain in my
shin, and expected a cool purple welt to form soon. Sadly, it has not.
So I'm left with a tender shin, and no cool battle scars!

Interestingly, the one thing that never happened was that the bike never
moved off course. The not inconsiderable impact did not push the bike
off course, nor did it cause me to put the bike out of control from some
gut reaction to the sudden impact. Delayed pain may have helped me
here, as I didn't feel a sudden sharp pain that I can remember.

What worries me about the accident is this: I don't think I could have
prevented it except by traveling much slower than I was. This is not
necessarily an unreasonable suggestion for a residential area, but I was
riding around the speed limit. I worry about what would have happened if
it had been a car instead of a dog, but I console myself with the
thought that it would take a truly insane BDI cager to whip out of a
blind driveway at 15-30 mph. For that matter, how many driveways are
long enough for a car to hit 30 mph by the end?

I eagerly await comment.

	The word that is missing in this whole discourse is not the "B"
word, or the "H" word, or even the "N" or "W" words. It is the "L" word -
LOSER !!

	That's right. When we boil all the crap out of this argument, it
is all about WINNING and LOSING, and nothing else. Let me explain.

	Remember the eighties ? No excuses. Nobody who can handle a mail
buffer can claim they are "too young" to remember Ronald Reagan - yet.
The eighties were about "How America Learned to Win Once Again". Then
(wouldn't you know), we won so well that there was nothing left to win.
No Cold War to endure. No nuclear holocaust. No more worlds to conquer
(We forgot about outer space long ago). The kind of overwhelming, no
holds barred success that killed Alexander the Great. Yes, there were a
few "little" problems along the way - stock market meltdown here, an
S&L bailout there, a few revolts and crazy Middle Eastern dictators to
contend with, but as Tacitus would tell ya', the God Augustus never had
it so good. 

	In the meantime, there is guilt for winning, maybe a fear that one
doesn't deserve one's bounty - or success. So there is a "kinder and gentler
type of politician these days, Bill Clinton, affirmative action, and lots of
discourse about people who "don't get it". For those of us in the winning
business, this kind of talk is mildly irritating, but there is still no 
suggestion of losing.

	But what do we find now ? To put it mildy, the stereotype of our 
"white male" non-winner is Woody Hayes in the Rose Bowl, punching out 
photojournalists when those California fruits and nuts steal another one
with a "Hail Mary" pass in the Fourth Quarter. (The whole idea behind 'three
yards and a cloud of dust' is to wear your opponent down until he collapses
in the final period) But Woody just used his fists - Uzzies seem to be the 
weapon of choice these days. 
	
	Who is D-FENS, anyway ? The answer is as plain as the horn rims on 
your face. The guy is MICHAEL DOUGLAS, posing as a LOSER. This 
is known as controversial casting. But that baggy short-sleeved white shirt 
sure does look natural on Mike doesn't it. Gordon Gekko will never look the 
same. (Though Woody always dressed that way.) Did we really expect Gekko to 
take it easy and enjoy that kind of wardrobe, without putting up a fuss ?

	What we are starting to lose sight of is, that bashing D-FENS is 
the same game as bashing that poor African American slug that Clint Eastwood
used to blow away all the time. As that arch-WASP (male gender) George C. Scott
declaimed, "Americans traditionally LOVE TO WIN. They love a winner, and will 
not tolerate a loser." And so on. 

	The political implications are simple. If, as many socialists - and
Democrats - do, you consider society a finite pie to a apportioned in some 
"equitable" way, then you have to worry about who is a winner and who is a 
loser to tell whose side you are on. That could be black women today, Asian
homosexuals tommorrow, and yes indeed, white men some yet to be determined
day when the balance of the pie has finally swung against that (39%) 
minority.

	Or you can just blow the whole thing off and say - as do most
conservatives and all the libertarians - and act is if you didn't care
who's winning and who's losing. In some cases, you might say something
about make sure the game is fair (equality of opportunity, not of condition).
In the latter case, you might be able to identify yourself as a 
"neoconservative" or a "neoliberal" depending on how much you want to limit
the pot.

	Either way you go, the way of the Winner is no longer the way to be
popular - at least after you graduate from High School (but you'll still
be popular at High School reunions). But it beats being a Nerd, as I 
would imagine Michael Douglas would now agree, and in the long run, it
is the only way to go. (Even in Hollywood, which treats Losers worse than any
other place in America except for New York and Washington, D.C. - and even in
Columbus, Ohio, which produced Alex Keaton, but no champion football teams in
the eighties and the first quarter of the nineties) I'd like to 
see more Winners in this society, regardless of race, gender, religious 
preference, and sexual orientation. Maybe we should even let a few more of 
them be white men !! (We should DEFINITELY let the Buckeyes win the Rose Bowl
someday)

Then as you understand it, what is it?

Yes.  I agree with that.  But what does that have to do with Jesus?
Punishment you say?  Jesus did not regard his death as punishment.

Good.  I wouldn't either--not the way you understand it.

Ask Jesus himself.  He himself said why in John 12:23-32.  It
isn't a mystery to anyone and there certainly is no need for
a persuasive argument.   Read Jesus's own reply to your
question.

Jesus gives more reasons in John 16:7.  But one obvious reason
why Jesus died, (and as with everything else, it has nothing do with
his punishment) was that he could rise to life again--so that
we would "stop doubting and believe" (John 21:27).  The fact
that Jesus rose from the dead is my hope that I too will rise
from the dead.  It is an obvious point.  Do not overlook it.
Without this obvious point, I would have no hope
and my faith would be vanity.

Why did Jesus suffer in his death?  Again, ask Jesus.  Jesus
says why in John 15:18-25.   That's no mystery either.  "The
world hates him without reason."  It is a direct proclamation
of how far we humans botch things up and thus, how much we
need a Saviour.

And why can't you, Brian K., accept this?  How can you?  "The
world cannot accept him because it neither sees him nor knows
him."  (John 14:17).   The animosity and the lack of knowledge
that comes out in your twistings of Robert's daily verses is
very convincing testimony of the truth of John 14:17 and 16:25.
I pray and hope that I do blurt out such animosity and lack of
knowledge. I am not perfect either.  But regardless of that, I thank
God that Jesus revealed himself to me, without whom I'd also be
bumbling about blindly though arrogantly slandering the very
Person who created me and who loves me.

If you do make it into New York state, the Palisades Interstate Parkway is a
pleasant ride (beautiful scenery, good road surface, minimal traffic).  You
may also want to take a sidetrip along Seven Lakes Drive just off the parkway
for the same reasons plus the road sweeps up and down along the hills with
sweeping turns under old forest canopy.

I got a male Mallard duck in the chest once.

It was like being kicked by my karate instructor.

No accident, but my eyes were tearing so hard, and I was wheezing
so loudly, that it's quite remarkable that I was able to come
to a stop with the rubber side up.

The duck, BTW, lived, and seemed quite healthy, though we both
sat by the roadside and shook our heads for a few minutes.

The bruise went from my right collar bone all the way down to
my belly button.

The balloons were in sufficiently low orbit that they experienced
some air resistance.  When they were finally punctured, this 
preasure (and the internal preasure that was needed to maintain
a spherical shape against this resistance) caused them to
catastrophically deflated.  The large silvered shards
that remained were easily visible for some time before
reentry, though no longer useful as a passive transponder.

As a general rule, no relay will cleanly switch audio if you try to tranfer
the circuit with the contacts.  The noise you hear is due to the momentary
opening and closing of the path.

The noiseless way of transfering audio is to ground the circuit.  In high
impedance audio circuits a resistive "T" is constructed close to characteristic
impedance of the circuit.  Grounding the imputs (connected to the T) transfers
the audio.

In low impedance circuits transformers are usually used, and the inputs are
shorted out or grounded.  Secondaries are paralleled at the characteristic
impedance.

Sometimes if it is necessary to actually switch audio, a second contact is used
to momentarily short the circuit output for the duration of the switching time.

Telephone relays are handy, because contacts can be adjusted to "Make before
break and Vica Versa" but I haven't seen any of these for years.

Nowadys switching is done electronically with OP amps, etc.

A novel circuit I used to build was a primitive "optical isolator".. It consists
of a resistive photocell and a lamp, all packaged in a tube.  When the lamp is
off the cell is high resistance.  Turn the lamp on and the resistance lowers
passing the audio.  Once again this device in a "T" switches the audio.  Varying
the lamp resistance give a remote volume control.  Use 2 variable resisters and
you have a mixer!

Lots of luck!

Hmmm.  Human gestation period is something like 39 weeks.  That means
third trimester abortions are those done after 26 weeks.  In consulting
a 1989 World Almanac, I see that 1% of abortions in 1983 were done at 
21 weeks or more.  That's about 1268 abortions in 1983 after 21 weeks.
Unless the number of abortions performed has dropped dramatically, or
a LOT of abortions are done between 21 and 26 weeks, I think you are
wrong.

By the way, Roe v. Wade allowed states to adopt very, very broad
prohibitions on third-trimester abortions, but some states, such as
California, declined to do so.  It was reported* that what finally 
stopped third trimester elective abortions in the Bay Area wasn't law, 
but that the only hospital doing them ran out of nurses, then doctors,
willing to do them.  Not surprisingly, the bay area NOW chapter was
terribly upset about this.

I remain pro-choice, but when pro-choicers compare abortion in a
clinic to a religious ritual in a church, you have to start wondering
a bit if the pro-life criticism of abortion as modern human sacrifice
doesn't have a grain of truth to it.

For an upcoming project I want to use 4 Megs of DRAM configured as two 2
Meg banks of 16 bit data.  I was wondering if anyone out there knows of a
DRAM controller which will handle refreshing the data.  It's ok if the
controller doesn't handle bank switching - that part is easy.

The only controllers I know of are the ones out of the National
Semiconductor DRAM Management Handbook (1988 edition) eg. DP8429.  I would
like to know if another manufacturer produces one which may be easier to
implement in my circuit.

BTW, if anyone is wanting to hook up DRAM to a microcontroller, Dallas
Semiconductor makes a neat chip: the DS1262 Serial DRAM Nonvolatizer
Chip.  It uses the SPI (I2C) bus and refreshes/controls up to 16Mx1 of DRAM
memory.  It can use an external battery to refresh the DRAM when the
power is off.  Price is $11.75 from Dallas (quan 1).  I wish I could use
this chip but its maximum SPI clock rate is 1 MHz (too slow for me...).

It's most likely a Kuiper Belt object, with an estimated diameter of
290 km.  The orbit hasn't been determined well enough yet to say much
more about it.

Could it be because you're British, Phill, and living in Germany?
While the EC working rules are more liberal than what we have in
the 1989 US-Canada FTA, there's probably a law about that (having
health insurance coverage is a condition of my being down here,
for example).

You have mentioned this once before, yet both the NY Times profile on
the German sickness funds (late Jan.) and pamphlets that my girlfriend
gives to her language students from the German consulate both say that
it is "voluntary" (okay, there were quotation marks (-;) and that only
90% of the population is covered by the sickness funds (analogous to
our provincial health insurances, but not divided by province/state).

Another guy in health care policy says that the Turkish guest workers
aren't covered ... he's written to me a couple of times (he's not a
post-er).  I'll ask him ...

The same way that any theory is proven false.  You examine the predicitions
that the theory makes, and try to observe them.  If you don't, or if you
observe things that the theory predicts wouldn't happen, then you have some 
evidence against the theory.  If the theory can't be modified to 
incorporate the new observations, then you say that it is false.

For example, people used to believe that the earth had been created
10,000 years ago.  But, as evidence showed that predictions from this 
theory were not true, it was abandoned.

My next project is to come up with an IF/detector module for fast -- 112
to 250 kB/sec -- packet radio use.  No fancy modulation scheme, just
wide FSK for use at 902 or 1296 MHz.

I'm a bit familiar with the Motorola 3362 chip, but I wonder if there
are newer designs that might work at higher input frequencies.

My goal is to come up with an inexpensive design for a receiver "back
end" with IF input on one end and an FSK demondulator on the other.  I'm
particularly interested in ways to use a higher IF than 10.7 -- do any
current chips work up to, say 150MHz with internal downconversion so a
normal IF filter can be used?

Any suggestions?

HOW NOT TO WRITE A DEED

One case involved the construction of a conveyance to grantees "jointly, as 
tenants in common, with equal rights and interest in said land, and to the 
survivor thereof, in fee simple. . . . To Have and to Hold the same unto the 
said parties hereto, equally, jointly, as tenants in common, with equal rights 
and interest for the period or term of their lives, and to the survivor thereof 
at the death of the other."

The court held that the survivorship provision indicated an intent to create a 
joint tenancy.  Germain v. Delaine, 294 Ala. 443, 318 So.2d 681 (1975).

I did hear this question asked during a radio news update of the case.  (They
were talking about the ongoing trial and had some audio clips).  Immediately
after the defense attorney asked the question, there was an "Objection!" heard
in the background.  The clip ended at that point so I don't know if the
objection was upheld.  I can't imagine NC is *that* bad.

This I didn't hear as an audio clip but heard it reported a number of times on
news stories both during and after the trial.  Now the "we did it on purpose"
thing is stretching, I think it was something more like--he had it coming.  If
somebody else remebers better than I on this second point, feel free to

Excuse me for sticking my nose in, but any parent/parents who do not allready 
immunize their children (especially if it is already free), don't deserve one 
frigging dime of tax money for health care for themselves, or public health 
care service.

(I know the immunization program and the coming national health care issue are

I remember seeing an artical on large-engine oil

the life of the oil was to run through a heated
un-presurized chamber to allow water and volitiles
to boil off. This made such long-term usage of

I have a thermal fuse from a Apple Laserwriter II power supply (Made

tubular thermal fuse like those found in hair driers etc, but is a 
rectangular plastic package, much like a transistor or diode.  It
is about 0.2"x0.2"x0.1", with both leads coming out of one of the
0.1"x0.1" sides.  I have been told that it was made by MITI, a asian
company, but I can find no information as to a supplier.  This fuse
is rated at 1A, 130C.  Does anyone have a source for this fuse?  I
only need 5 or so, which means that the manufacturer wouldn't even want

our federal government that the space program is a worth while
investment!

I hope that I will live to see the day we walk on Mars, but
we need to address the technical hurdles first!  If there's sufficient
interest, maybe we should consider starting a sci.space group 
devoted to the technical analysis of long-duration human spaceflight.

This sounds like another of Ali AbuTaha's 57 different "real causes" of
the Challenger accident.  As far as I know, there has never been the
slightest shred of evidence for a "harmonic resonance" having occurred.

The windshear-induced maneuvering probably *did* contribute to opening
up the leak path in the SRB joint again -- it seems to have sealed itself
after the puffs of smoke during liftoff -- but the existing explanation
of this and related events seems to account for the evidence adequately.

You seem to be saying that a LIMITED government will provide MORE
opportunities for private interests to use it to pursue their own
agendas, and asking libertarians to prove that this will NOT happen.
While I can't offer such a proof, it seems pretty damn plausible that
if the government does not regulate a particular area, it cannot become
a tool of private interests to pursue their own agendas in that area.
I rather suspect that it's the sort of government we have NOW that is
more likely to become such a tool, and that it IS such a tool in many
instances.

I suspect that this is because "improvement in the human condition" as
you define it is not the primary goal of libertarianism, and would not
be the primary goal of a libertarian government.  My impression of
libertarianism is that its primary goal is the elimination of
government coercion except in a very limited cases.

To the degree that relativism is a more accurate decription of the
truth than is objectivism, it provides more power and ability to
control events.

Assuming, for the moment, that morals _are_ relative, then two
relativists can recognize that neither has a lock on the absolute
truth and they can proceed to negotiate a workable compromise that
produces the desired results.

Assuming that there is an absolute morality, two disagreeing 
objectivists can either be both wrong or just one of them right; there
is no room for compromise.  Once you beleive in absolute morals,
you must accept that you are amoral or that everyone who disagrees
with you is amoral.

Given a choice between a peaceful compromise or endless contention,
I'd say that compromise seems to be "better".

   Two developments have brought these type of activities back to
the forefront in 1993.  First, in February, the Russians deployed a
20-m reflector from a Progress vehicle after it had departed from
the Mir Space Station.  While this "Banner" reflector was blank,
NPO Energia was very active in reporting that future  Banner
reflectors will be available to advertisers, who could use a space-
based video of their logo or ad printed on the Banner in a TV
commercial, as filmed from the Mir.
   The second development, has been that Space Marketing Inc, the
same company responsible for merchandising space on the Conestoga
booster and COMET spacecraft, is now pushing the "Environmental
Billboard".  As laid out by SMI Chief Engineer Dr Ron Humble of the
University of Colorado Space Laboratory and Preston Carter of the
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, the "Environmental
Billboard" is a large inflatable outer support structure of up to
804x1609 meters.  Advertising is carried by a mylar reflective area,
deployed by the inflatable 'frame'.
   To help sell the concept, the spacecraft responsible for
maintaining the billboard on orbit will carry "ozone reading
sensors" to "continuously monitor the condition of the Earth's
delicate protective ozone layer," according to Mike Lawson, head of
SMI. Furthermore, the inflatable billboard has reached its minimum
exposure of 30 days it will be released to re-enter the Earth's
atmosphere. According to IMI, "as the biodegradable material burns,
it will release ozone-building components that will literally
replenish the ozone layer." The remaining spacecraft will monitor
the atmosphere for another year before it, too, re-enters and burns
up and "adds to the ozone supply."
   This would not be a cheap advertisement, costing at least several
millions of dollars (exact costs were not available).  But SMI
estimates that market exposure would be 3-5X that of the people who
watched the SuperBowl, where a 30-second advertising 'unit' cost
$600,000.  Since SMI is located in Atlanta, Georgia, it is being
promoted as being available in time for the opening of the 1996
Summer Olympics in Atlanta.
  
But back to Brian's questions:
>And does anyone have any more details other than what was in the WN
>news blip?  How serious is this project?  Is this just in the "wild
>idea" stage or does it have real funding?
  
    See above. As for serious -- if they can get $15-20 M or so (my
estimate of $5-10 for development costs and a flight unit, plus
$10-15 M for a launch), then it's probably real.  They are claiming to
tailor the orbit to overfly specific locations at specific times for
optimum advertising impact so they probably can't piggy back upon
someone else's planned launch and will have to buy a dedicated
launch.  That's a $10-15 M cost they need to raise, right there.
    And there will probably be some legal challenges to this as
well.  Note there is one potential legal challenge to SMI on the use
of launch vehicle advertising already.  While I don't think the
legal challenges would win out (and yes, I am an amateur astronomer,
and no, I don't really like the idea of this additional light
pollution, but I know of no prohibition of it...),  the legal
challenges and court fights would probably remove any positive
aspects of the advertising.  I can imagine several ways to make the
advertisers look like louts for doing this -- which would change
positive market exposure to negative market exposure, and negate the
space advertising advantage.  (Would you spend $15 M to look like an
idiot?)
   (And light pollution might not be too bad -- if it's in a low
enough orbit, and it relies upon reflected light only, it would
only be visible for a short time just after local dusk and before
dawn.  For maximum market exposure, you want to have it visible just
after dusk --minimizing impact on astronomy, since that's the time
of worse seeing due to day/night thermal turbulence.  It might still
be a problem, but perhaps there are ways to mitigate this...)
    As for having real funding -- none that I can identify.  There
were about 60 expressions of interest made on the Conestoga
advertising opportunity, but that included curious folks and was for
only a $500,000 commitment.  I haven't heard of any serious funding
for this, but I'm sure they are shopping the venture around looking
for some money in order to flesh out the concept some more.  But I
am confident there are no firm or paying customers at this time.
  
   And if anybody wants to cross-post this to sci.astro, please be
my guest.  I don't have posting privileges to that area (or at least
I don't THINK I do...).

The problem is, your use of the word "objective" along with "values."
Both definitions three and four are inherently subjective, that is
they are particular to a given individual, or personal. You see,
what one person may see as worthwhile, another may see as worthless.

>If on the other hand, some things *have* objective worth, usefulness,
>or importance, it would be interesting to know what they are.

Again, your form of measurement in this sentence, that being of "worth"
is subjective.

>how you use the term "objective".

When I find that my usage of a word is different than the usage of
that word given by another person, I try to find a standard against
which to judge that usage. In most cases, the dictionary is the standard
I use. Here is a definiton of objective:

objective ADJ. 1. Of or having to do with a material object as 
distinguished from a mental concept. 2. Having actual existance.
3.a. Unenfluenced by emotion or personal prejudice. b. Based on
observable phenomenon.

By this definition, science does not have an objective worth, since the
phrase "objective worth" is an oxymoron. However you asked something a 
little differently this time, you asked for an objective basis for a
notion. The fact that the use of science as an intellectual tool is
responsible for changes in our world (the changes are material, and
thus "objective") would provide an objective _basis_ for an argument.
However, the conclusion arrived at from that argument (that science is 
"good") is subjective.

I think that the problem here is one of word usage. Take a little time
and read the definitions of these words: objective, subjective, worth,
value, morality, good, evil. I believe that if you think about the 
meaning of them for a while, you will have to conclude that there is no
such thing as an objective morality.

There's also Billy Jack, The Wild One, Smokey and the Bandit
(Where Jerry Reed runs his truck over Motorcycle Gangs Bikes),
and a video tape documentary on the Hell's Angels I
found in a rental store once



The following is an introduction as to who is Muhammad SAW
as will be covered with this treatise.

MUHAMMAD peace and blessings of Allah be upon him (SAW)
is the last prophet of Islam.  He is the Prophet who is revealed
the last Holy Scripture, Qur'an, by Allah SWA (all praise be to Him)
through the Arch Angel Gabriel.  He is the seal of all prophets
till the day of judgement as stated in the Qur'an by Allah
SWA (all praise be to Him).  Muhammad SAW lived between
571-632 AC.  All other prophethoods claimed after Muhammad SAW,
is a treason against Islam, against Qur'an, against the message
of Allah SWA.  Muhammad SAW is from the seed of Ishmael, another
messenger of Allah and son of Abraham also a messenger of Allah.
He is the Messenger that previous holy scriptures foretold his
coming.  The above mentioned verse from the Qur'an is from 
Chapter 33, Verse 40 whose rough translation is as follows:

	Muhammad is not the father of any of your men,
	but (he is) the messenger of Allah, and the seal
	of the prophets, and Allah has full knowledge of
	all things.

---------------------
Commentary on the above verse:  When a document is sealed,
it is complete, and there can be no further addition.  The 
Holy Prophet Muhammad SAW closed the long line of Messengers.
Allah's teaching is and will always be continuous, but there
has been and will be NO Prophet after Muhammad SAW.  The later
ages will want thinkers, and revivers, not Prophets.  This is not
an arbitrary matter.  It is a decree full of knowledge and wisdom,
"for Allah has full knowledge of all things."

   		 NINETEENTH LETTER  

		 MU'JIZAT-I AHMEDIYE RISALESI 
(A TREATISE ON THE MIRACLES OF MUHAMMED SAW)       

(continued from Droplet Vol 1, No 11, Part 1)

   SECOND  SIGN:   The  Noble  Messenger  (SAW)
declared His prophethood, and presented to humanity a
decree as the Glorious Qur'an and manifest miracles
which number, according to the scholars, one thousand.
The occurrence of those miracles in their entirety is as
certain as the fact that He declared himself prophet.  In
fact, as a shown by the words of the  most obstinate
unbelievers quoted in various places of the Wise
Our'an, even they could not deny the occurrence of His
miracles, but only called them -hasha wa kella!-(Allah forbids) 
sorcery, in order to satisfy themselves, or to deceive their
followers.  The miracles of Muhammad (SAW) have the
certainty of confirmation by consensus of Ulema (scholars
of Islam) to the hundreth degree.
   The Miracle is the conformation by the CREATOR of
the universe of His declaration of Prophethood; it has the
effect of the words,'You have indeed spoken the truth !'
   Suppose that you said in the assembly of a ruler,
while being observed by Him, 'The true ruler has
appointed me to such and such position.  'At a time when
you were asked to prove your claim, the word 'Yes'
uttered by the ruler would sufficiently support you.  Or, if
the ruler changed his usual practice and attitude at your
request, this would confirm your claim even more soundly
and more definitely than would the word 'Yes.'
   In the same way, ALLAH's Most Noble Messenger
claimed: 'I am the envoy of the CREATOR of this
universe.  My proof is that He will change His unbroken
order at my request and my prayer.  Now look at my
fingers:  He makes them run like a fountain with five
spigots.  Look at the moon: by a gesture of my finger, He
splits it in two.  Look at that tree: to affirm me, and to bear
witness to me, it moves and comes near to me.  Look at
this food: although it is barely enough for two or three
men, it satisfies two or three hundred.  'Further he shows
hundreds of similar miracles.  However, the evidences  of
the veracity of this high being and the proofs of his
prophethood are not restricted to his miracles.  All his
deeds and acts, his words and behavior, his moral
conduct and manners, his character and appearance
prove to the attentive his truthfulness and seriousness.
Indeed, many people  such  as  Abdullah  b. Salam,  the
famous scholar of the Children of Israel, came to belief
merely by seeing him, and said, 'No lie can hide in this
face, nor can any fraud be found in it!'
   Although many of the  researchers have concluded
that the proofs of the prophethood of Muhammad and his
miracles number about one thousand, there are
thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands of proofs  of
his prophethood.  And hundreds of thousands of
truth-seeking men (muhakkikiin) with varying opinions
have affirmed his prophethood in an equal number of
ways.
   The Wise Our'an alone demonstrates thousands of
the proofs of his prophethood, in addition to its own forty
aspects of miraculousness.  Since prophethood is as a
phenomenon of humanity, and hundreds of thousands of
individuals who claimed prophethood and performed
miracles have lived and passed away; then, the
prophethood of Muhammad (SAW) is of a certanity
superior to that of the prophethood of all the others.  For
whatever evidences, qualities  and attributes  became the
means of the prophethood and messengership of all the
messengers such as Jesus (AS) and Moses (AS), they
are all owned in a more perfect and comprehensive
fashion by Muhammad (SAW).  And since the causes and
means of prophetic authority exist more perfectly in the
person of Muhammad (SAW), this authority is to be found
in him with more certanity than all the other prophets.

This is a difficult problem for which there is no obviously good
solution.  One approach is simply to try and move political opinion
and hope a new more libertarian consensus lasts for a while.  Another
approach is to try and amend the constitution.  The original
constitution restrained the U.S. government from economic intervention
for 100 to 150 years, depending on just how one wants to count it.
The First Amendment, though weakened in many ways, still restrains
government (particularly state and local), even though on many
particular issues the majority is in favor of censorship.  I think
libertarians would be happy with another 100 years of restraint via
an amendment or two (not that I think that's likely to happen).

Not necessarily Mr. Hendricks, but other posters seem to see this as
a problem with libertarianism, that it cannot be stable.  That might
be true, but it is not an objection to libertarianism per se.  If
a libertarian political consensus forms for a decade or two and then
falls apart again, we would just be back where we are now.  This is
unlike the case for socialism where a socialist consensus that held
for a while and then fell apart would not leave us where we are now,
but instead with lots of bureaucracy that would be hard to get rid of,
if not tyranny as the end condition of a strong socialist consensus.

Okay, Del, so Michael was being unfair, but you are being unfair back.  
He is taking college courses now, I presume he is studying hard, and
his postings reveal that he is *somewhat* hip to the technical issues
of astronautics.  Plus, he is attentively following the erudite
discourse of the Big Brains who post to sci.space; is it not
inevitable that he will get a splendid technical education from
reading the likes of you and me? [1]

Like others involved in sci.space, Mr. Adams shows symptoms of being a
fledgling member of the technoculture, and I think he's soaking it up
fast.  I was a young guy with dreams once, and they led me to get a
technical education to follow them up.  Too bad I wound up in an
assembly-line job stamping out identical neutrinos day after day...

The Roman Catholic conservatives are coming out in the open to line
up with Pat Robertson and his ultra Right Wing Christian Coalition.
Former Secretary of Education William Bennet, a Roman Catholic, stood
beside the Christian Coalition's spokesman Ralph Reed at a March 3
conference in Washington.  The purpose of the conference was to
publish results of a Christian Coalition poll which was designed
to prove that the Republican party would lose major support if it
backed away from the "Family Values" positons of the '92 convention.

Conservative Catholics have swung behind Robertson's organization
with political expertise, legal assistance and high tech communications
support.

The Catholic Campaign for  American, designed as a Catholic version
of the Moral Majority, was founded by Marlene Elwell and Tom Wykes.
Ms. Elwell has been with Robertson since the days of his Freedom
Council in 1985 and worked for him in his presidential bid in 1988.

Ms. Elwell was hired by Domino's Pizza magnate, Tom Monaghan, in 1989
to manage Legatus, a "nonpolitical", Catholic businessmen's group.
Membership is limited to Catholics who head corporations with a least $4
million in annual revenues.  Relying on a network of wealthy contacts
at Legatus, Elwell and Wykes had little trouble forming and funding the
Catholic Campaign.

The Campaign's list of national committee members includes U.S. Rep.
Robert K. Dornan, Phyllis Schlafly of the Eagle Forum, the lovely
Pat Buchanan and Rev. Richard J. Neuhaus.   Also on the national
committee is Keith Fournier, a Catholic who heads Pat Robertson's
American Center for Law and Justice.  Another Catholic, Thomas
Patrick Monaghan, senior counsel of Robertson's ACLJ, is also an
active supporter of the Catholic Campaign.

The board of directors includes Frank Shakespeare, broadcasting exec
and former U.S. ambassador to the Pope, Wall Street executive Frank
Lynch, former Reagan official Richard V. Allen, Bishop Rene Gracida
of Corpus Christi and Mary Ellen Bork, wife of unsuccessful Supreme
Court nominee Robert Bork.

In the Winter 1992 issue of _Campaign Update_ the organization's
quarterly newsletter, Rocco L. Martino, a Philadelphia business
executive wrote: "Separation of church and state is a false premise
that must finally be cast aside and replaced by the true meaning of
our constitution."

Oh yes, the organization's "national ecclesisatical advisor" is
Catholic politician Cardinal John J. O'Connor of New York.

     Now doesn't this sound a lot like the "colorful (or otherwise) story 
     from antiquity that somehow tries to (or does) explain natural pheno-
     mena"?  I think I hear what you're saying, but I'm not convinced that
     I know what you mean.  The possibility exists that what _looks_ like
     "myth" on the surface may be after all much more than "just" a story.

Hi all,

I'm an assistant manager at a local art theater here in Columbus.  I'd
like to expand our show automation a bit- namely add the capability to
use cue tapes to bring the houselights up.  Our current automation
consoles date from the early 60's and don't provide this function.

We already have the combo failsafe/contact rollers to read the cuetapes,
and our dimmer system will raise the houselights when its fade-up control
circuit (120 VAC) is momentarily closed, for at least 0.5 second.

I've tried wiring the dimmer control to a 12V relay, activated when the
cue tape completes the circuit.  Low tech and simple, but there's one
problem:  In order to get the 1/2 second pulse, there needs to be
a sh**load of cuetape on the film.  (35mm runs at 90 feet per minute,
so to get a 1/2 second pulse, there needs to be at least 9 inches of solid
cuetape!)

Ideally, I would like to use a single cross-cue to accomplish this function.
(A single strip of cuetape perpendicular to the length of the film)
This would give a pulse of approximately 1/100 of a second.
What I need is a circuit to detect the short cue and activate the relay
for around 1/2 second.  The ability to adjust how long the relay
is activated would be nice.  I figure this would require an RC circuit
of some sort.  I'm sure some of you already have the solution figured
out in your heads.  Any suggestions and schematics would be appreciated!


Thanks,

Mark Fontana

Actually, a lot of this work used to be done with a CRT that had a beamsplitter
mounted in front, and a tachistoscope driving it.  The tachistoscope is really
just a slide projector with a very fast shutter.  Low tech, but it does the job.

Let us explore this interesting paragraph point by point, sentence by
sentence.


1) We are talking about origins, not merely science.

Origins of what?  Are we speaking of the origins of life, the human
species, the universe, physical law, biological diversity or what?

2) Science cannot explain origins.

This is a false statement unless it is carefully qualified.  It depends
on what origins we are talking about.

3) For a person to exclude anything but science from the issue of origins
is to say that there is no higher truth than science.

Again, this is a false statement.  To begin with, the notion of "higher
truth" is distinctly dubious.  Many people believe that there are ways
to ascertain truth that are not in the repetoire of science; they even
believe that there are ways that are more reliable and certain.  Many
believe that there are truths that cannot be expressed using the language
of science.  Let it be so.  These truths are neither "higher" or 
"lower"; they are simply true.

More to the point, restricting one's discussion of origins to science
does not reject other sources of knowledge; it simply restricts the
scope of discussion.

4) This is a false premise.

If this is intended as asserting that the previous sentence was false
then (4) is actually true.  However the context identifies it as another
false [or at least theologically unsound] statement.

5) By the way, I enjoy science.

On the evidence Mr. Rawlins lacks sufficient understanding of science
to enjoy science in any meaningful sense.  One might just as well say
that one enjoys literature written in a language that one cannot read.
However one cannot mark this sentence as false -- to follow the analogy,
perhaps he likes the pretty shapes of the letters.

6) It is truly a wonder observing God's creation.

Let us not quibble; count this one as true.

7) Macroevolution is a mixture of 15 percent science and 85 percent
religion [guaranteed within three percent error :) ]

Still another false statement.  However one can make it come out true
with the following contextual modification:

"Macroevolution, as misunderstood by Rawline, is a mixture of 15 percent
of what Rawlins erroneously thinks of as science, and 85 percent of
what Rawlins erroneously thinks of as religion."

-----

It is distinctly noticeable that Mr. Rawlins fails miserably to touch
on truth except when he reports personally on what he feels.  [I do
him the justice of assuming that he is not misinforming us as to his
personal reactions.]  One can account for this by the hypothesis that
he has an idiosyncratic and personal concept of truth.

There may be some confusion here.  The Uniform Crime Reports program
run by the FBI defines rape as a female victim only crime -- even
though some states have the laws de-sexed.  I suspect that this causes
male victims of rape to be left out of the UCR data.

He also ignores a few other things.  While organics would become
significantly more expensive were all the oil to disappear (and thus
some things would no longer be economically feasible), oil is hardly
an irreplaceable resource any more than most other consumables.  As
supply decreases, prices rise and alternatives become more
competetive.  He also needs to consider that there has been an
estimated 30 years of reserves pretty much as long as anyone has cared
about petroleum; whatever the current usage rate is, we always seem to
have about a 30 year reserve that we know about.

[I'm not sure that last figure is still true -- we tend not to look as
hard when prices are comparatively cheap -- but it was certainly true
during hte 'oil crisis' days of the 70's.]

OK.  I stand corrected.  I guess, then, that the comments about payoffs
(i.e., "pork") to Puerto Ricans that others have been making still
stands?

Now, everybody, how about some opinion on the following related topic:

Should the people who are natives of U.S. territories have
representation in the U.S. House of Rep's or the U.S. Congress?
The U.S. Constitution sets up the House of Representatives to represent
each State in proportion to its population, and the Senate to represent
each State equally.  What should be done with U.S. territories like
Puerto Rico?  Does anyone have knowledge about how this was handled in
the past, such as with the Louisiana Territory or the Northwest
Territory?

They require two separate grounds.  One ground goes to the ground pin
of the outlet, and the other ground wire is connected to the outlet's
mounting tabs (and thus grounds the box and faceplate screw and metal
faceplate, if any).

The box/faceplate ground goes to the normal distribution panel ground.
The outlet ground-pin wire is generally connected to an insulated
busbar in the distribution panel which is, in turn, connected to
the building-entrance main ground by its own wire.

So the two separate ground systems are connected together at the
building's service entrance.  But one is also connected to every
grounded piece of electrical equipment in the whole building,
while the isolated ground is shared only by the equipment plugged
into isolated-ground outlets of that panel.  If someone happens
to accidentally short one phase of a 600V feeder to ground,
the main building ground is likely to have a lot of noise on it
until the breaker trips or the fuse blows, while the isolated
ground will remain relatively noise-free.

I told some friends of mine two weeks ago that Koresh was dead.  The FBI and
the BATF could not let a man like that live.  He was a testimonial to their
stupidity and lies.    

Now before everyone gets crazy with me, let me say that Koresh was crazy as 
a bed bug, but out government was crazier...and they lied to us.

They told us compound had been under survaillance for quite some time.  Yet, 
whoever was watching the place failed to see that Koresh went jogging and into
town on a regular basis.  Everyone in the area claimed to have seen him and 
wondered why they didn't pick him up then.  There are two possible answers.
First, they didn't see him.  What kind of survaillance is that?  Second, they
didn't care.  They wanted a confrontation.  They wanted publicity and they got
it.

After the first battle, they told us that they did not know he knew they were
coming.  They also said it would have been foolish to go in knowing that.
Well, we know now that they intercepted the informants call and went in anyway.

Did they explore all of the possibilities for ending the seige?  According to
them they did, but according to the Hartford Courant, the woman that raised
Koresh (His Grandmother) was not allowed to go in and see him.                 
 The FBI agent who she spoke with was Bob Ricks and according to the paper he
said:

"A lot of people think if you just talk to them logically they will come out.
His grandmother raised Vernon Howell; (Koresh's Real name)  she didn't raise
David Koresh."

Someone who raises you and loves you does not speak to you strickly on a
logical level.  There is also an emotional level on which they can reach you.

Here's another one.  All during this operation the FBI has been claiming that
they feared a mass suicide and that is one of the reasons that something must
be done.  Now they claim they never thought he would do it?

I knew they were going to do something when they started talking about how
much money this was costing.  That was the start of the "Justification" part
part of the plan.  That's when I knew it would come soon.

But, back to the plan.  It is considered "Cruel and Unusal Punishment" to
execute criminals in the minds of many people, but look at what's acceptable.

They knew the parents (adults) had gas masks.  They did not know, or were not
sure, if the children had them.  So the plan was to pour the gas into the 
compound.  The mothers, seeing what the gas was doing to their children were
supposed to run out and that would only leave the men to deal with.

I spent two years in the army and like everyother veteran I went through CBR
(Chemical, Biological Radiological) warfare training.  Part of that training
is going into a room filled with the same stuff that the children were
subjected to.  To make the stuff really interesting the gas also has a chemical 
agent that irritates the skin.  You think its on fire.

I have no doubts the children would become hysterical.  Its not the kind of
thing you never want to do again.  This was the plan, the final solution.

We waited 444 days for our hostages to come home from Iran.  We gave these
people 51 days.  

I stated on several occasions that there was absolutely nothing in this whole
thing that the government could point to as a success.  Well, FBI agent Ricks
changed my mind.  Again a newclip from the Hartford Courant:

"And while expressing regret at the loss of life, he suggested that the
operation had been at least a modified success because not a single federal
shot had been fired and not a single federal agent had been hurt."

It took 17 dead children to get us that new definition of success.

One more thought.  The government claimed that they believed he had automatic
weapons on the premises. 
                                                      
        HE HAD A LICENSE FOR THE 50 CALIBER MACHINE GUN!

THEY KNEW DAMN WELL HE HAD ONE. THEY ALSO KNEW HE HAD IT LEGALLY!

Still, without the element of surprise they sent in agents to get him.
For all of this my President takes full responsibility.  What a guy!
I hope he gets it.

Reading from a Amoco Performance Products data sheet, their
ERL-1906 resin with T40 carbon fiber reinforcement has a compressive
strength of 280,000 psi.  It has a density of 0.058 lb/cu in,
therefore the theoretical height for a constant section column
that can just support itself is 4.8 million inches, or 400,000 ft,
or 75 Statute miles.

Now, a real structure will have horizontal bracing (either a truss
type, or guy wires, or both) and will be used below the crush strength.
Let us assume that we will operate at 40% of the theoretical 
strength.  This gives a working height of 30 miles for a constant
section column.  

A constant section column is not the limit on how high you can
build something if you allow a tapering of the cross section
as you go up.  For example, let us say you have a 280,000 pound
load to support at the top of the tower (for simplicity in
calculation).  This requires 2.5 square inches of column cross
sectional area to support the weight.  The mile of structure
below the payload will itself weigh 9,200 lb, so at 1 mile 
below the payload, the total load is now 289,200 lb, a 3.3% increase.

The next mile of structure must be 3.3% thicker in cross section
to support the top mile of tower plus the payload.  Each mile
of structure must increase in area by the same ratio all the way
to the bottom.  We can see from this that there is no theoretical
limit on area, although there will be practical limits based
on how much composites we can afford to by at $40/lb, and how
much load you need to support on the ground (for which you need
a foundation that the bedrock can support.

Let us arbitrarily choose $1 billion as the limit in costruction
cost.  With this we can afford perhaps 10,000,000 lb of composites,
assuming our finished structure costs $100/lb.  The $40/lb figure
is just for materials cost.  Then we have a tower/payload mass
ratio of 35.7:1.  At a 3.3% mass ratio per mile, the tower
height becomes 111 miles.  This is clearly above the significant
atmosphere.  A rocket launched from the top of the tower will still
have to provide orbital velocity, but atmospheric drag and g-losses
will be almost eliminated.  G-losses are the component of
rocket thrust in the vertical direction to counter gravity,
but which do not contribute to horizontal orbital velocity.  Thus
they represent wasted thrust.  Together with drag, rockets starting
from the ground have a 15% velocity penalty to contend with.

This analysis is simplified, in that it does not consider wind
loads.  These will require more structural support over the first
15 miles of height.  Above that, the air pressure drops to a low
enough value for it not to be a big factor.

It's my understanding that the freezing will start to occur because of the
growing distance of Pluto and Charon from the Sun, due to it's
elliptical orbit. It is not due to shadowing effects.

Pluto can shadow Charon, and vice-versa.

Is there any difference in saying 

"Absolute Truth exists, but some people think its a lie"

and

"Truth is relative" ?

I think there is:  in both examples, the first statement is a
fundamental disagreement between at least two people; the 
second statement is agreed upon by all.

To put it another way, someone who says objective values exist
does not agree that values are subjective.

Assuming 68HC11...
In expanded muxed mode, you *could* do it. Much easier if you get a DRAM
controller IC. The MMI 673102 could be used to implement this, or you
could use a counter and a huge multiplexer to provide row/column/refresh
address multiplexing. The thing with DRAMs is that they require wierd
timing, address multiplexing, and refresh.

Actually, if you wanted to use a 68008 IC, you could look at AN897, which
has a neat controller built in. There is also the 683xx, I think one
of those has the DRAM controller built in. This one is for the 6664
DRAM, however, the 41256 has only one more address line, adding only
another component or so. The 256k SIMMs are basically 8 or 9 41256
DRAM chips (or their equivalent in fewer packages).

It *can* be done, just takes a bit of logic design. I'm actually
about to do it using a 65C02P3 chip... I've got 8 256k simms... that's
2 megabytes on my Apple //e... (used to be in my '386).

Very easily. Show them pictures of crime scenes perpetrated by Christian
terrorists in this country, if that doesn't convince them have them talk
to the victims of Christian terrorism. 

A brutal act of terrorism inspired by Christian propoganda was recently
commited on your very campus. 

Its very simple religious extremists of all religions put no value on
human life. Christian and Islamic fundamentalists put advancing there
religion above all else, even if doing so violates the religion itself.

P.S. I'm not saying all Christians are terrorists, I'm using "Christian
     terrorist" in the same way the media uses Islamic terrorist.

The first means that some aspect of reality contains objective values.
The second means that values are a reference to some preference of the
individual.  In the first case, it is possible that some future discovery
might invalidate certain views re what objective values are.

to output a FutureNet netlist, and then import this into PADS-PCB.  Is there
another way of doing this?  I didn't see any information in the instructions

Oh, no, not in this case. I've noticed that you conveniently edited out your
stupid comment that the PRC stands for Cambodia. When we're arguing the
Vietnam war and about Cambodia, and you toss in a boner like that (along
with your other boners), you are an ignorant asshole.

Oh, and even the Vietnamese agree that they did far more damage to
Cambodia than we ever did.

John 12:24-26: "Most assuredly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat
falls onto the ground and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it
produces much grain.
  "He who loves his life will lose it, and he who hates his life in
this world will keep it for eternal life.
  "If anyone serves Me, let him follow Me; and where I am, there My
servant will be also.  If anyone serves Me, him My Father will honor."

Why would I want an eternal life if I hate this one?

If we were created by a deity, why would that deity not wish us to
enjoy what he has given us?

Why would I want to live forever?  The challenge in my life is that I
will die, and that I must give my life the meaning I wish it to have
before that happens.  My time is here and will someday pass; I will be
content to live on in the memories of my friends, and once they too
are dead, then I will no longer have any reason to exist.

In short: even if your deity *does* exist, that doesn't automatically
mean that I would worship it.  I am content to live my own life, and
fend for myself, so when I die, I can be proud of the fact that no
matter where I end up, it will be because of *my* actions and *my* choices.

If your god decides to toss me into a flaming pit for this, then so be
it.  I would much rather just cease to exist.  But if your god wants
my respect and my obedience, then it had better earn these; and if it
does, then they will be very strong and true.

Jesus wasn't the only one who rose from the dead -- I think it was
Osiris who did the same, as well as a few characters from Greek or
Norse legend, if memory serves.

But still: WHY would I want to rise from the dead?  Why do *you* want to?

If your god wants to win my devotion, then it knows what it can do --
provide some way for me to believe without having to resort to blind
faith that could be applied equally well to any religion.

>And why can't you, Brian K., accept this?  How can you?  "The

That's precisely it.  I neither see nor know Zeus either, nor Odin.
Shall I offer them the same devotion I offer Jesus?

You've got to understand my point-of-view: I see Christians spouting
Bible verse all the time as if it were some sort of magic spell that
will level all opposition.  Truth is, it's not.  Robert has never
demonstrated that he actually understands what the verses imply; he
just rattles them off day by day.  Some brazenly fly in the face of
common sense and reality, and I point these out where I can.

But even more than that, even when Christians *do* try to explain the
verses in their own words, they do so from a Christian point of view,
which is that every human being would want to be a Christian if only
he or she understood the Christian message properly, and then all
strife and suffering on the earth would end.  Here's the problem with
that: substitute "Moslem" or "Buddhist" or "Satanist" instead of
"Christian", and it means the same thing.

Christanity is a very nice belief set around a very nice book.  But if
you want to make me believe that it has any bearing on the REAL WORLD,
you've got some convincing to do.

And in my opinion, you're bumbling about blindly making up entities
where there aren't any, and depriving yourself of a true understanding
and enjoyment of your life.  As long as you keep your beliefs to
yourself, I'll keep my beliefs to myself -- but as soon as you start
waving them around, expect me to toss in my opinions, too.

Since the DC-X is to take off horizontal, why not land that way??
Why do the Martian Landing thing..  Or am I missing something.. Don't know to
much about DC-X and such.. (overly obvious?).

Why not just fall to earth like the russian crafts?? Parachute in then...

	If given a definite definition of "God", it is sometimes possible to 
falsify the existance of that God. 
	But, when one refuses to give an immutable definition, one can not.

                    INTERVIEW OF THE PRESIDENT
                      BY MICHAEL WHITELY OF
                    KDKA-AM RADIO, PITTSBURGH
	     
                 Pittsburgh International Airport
                     Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania    



10:40 A.M. EDT
	     
	     
	     Q	  For everyone listening on KDKA Radio, I'm Mike 
Whitely, KDKA Radio News.  We're here at the Pittsburgh 
International Airport and with me is the President of the United 
States Bill Clinton.
	     
	     And I'd like to welcome you to the area and to KDKA.
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Mike.  Glad to be here.
	     
	     Q	  There are a lot of things we'd like to talk 
about in the brief amount of time we have, but some news is just 
breaking from Los Angeles.  I guess the entire country has been 
kind of holding their breath, wondering what's going to happen in 
the trial of the four Los Angeles police officers.  We just heard 
that two of those officers, the sergeant, Sergeant Koon and 
Officer Powell have been found guilty, and two officers have been 
found not guilty.
	     
	     It's a situation that's been building for over a 
year since the first trial and now this trial and this verdict.  
And I wonder what your thoughts are this morning on how you see 
the situation in Los Angeles in connection with your 
administration and what you're trying to do.
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, first of all, I think the 
American people should know that this trial, in my judgment, is a 
tribute to the work and judgment of the jury, as well as to the 
efforts of the federal government in developing the case.
	     
	     The law under which the officers were tried is a 
complex one; the standards of proof are complicated.  The jury 
decided that they would convict the sergeant who was responsible 
for supervising the officers and the officer who on the film did 
most of the beating.  The jury acquitted an officer who kicked 
Rodney King, but also plainly tried to shield him from some 
blows, and another officer who was a rookie.
	     
	     No one knows exactly why they did what they did, but 
it appears that they really tried to do justice here.  They 
acknowledged that his civil rights were violated.  And I think 
that the American people should take a lot of pride in that.  But 
I hope now we can begin to look ahead and focus on three things:  
first of all, the importance of trying to bring this country 
together and not violate the civil rights of any American; 
secondly, the importance of renewing our fight against crime.  
	     
	     I think it's important to recognize that in the 
poorest areas of Los Angeles and many other cities in this 
country, people may be worried about police abuse, but they're 
even more worried about crime.  It's time that we renewed our 
efforts to go to community policing -- put 100,000 more police 
officers on the street; pass the Brady Bill that would require a 
waiting period before people could buy a handgun, and do some 
other things to reduce the vulnerability of our people to 
violence and drugs.
	     
	     And the last point I'd like to make is it seems to 
me that we have got to rededicate ourselves to the economic 
revitalization of our cities and other economically-distressed 
areas.  If you just think about it -- if everybody in Los Angeles 
who wanted a job had one, I don't think we'd have quite as many 
problems as we do.  
	     
	     And I laid out a very ambitious program in the 
campaign to try to bring private investment and public investment 
to bear in our cities.  I have dispatched the Commerce Secretary, 
Ron Brown, to California to try to come up with some strategies 
for that state, because it's our biggest state with our highest 
unemployment rate -- which could then be applied around the 
country.  I want to talk to him and to the Attorney General, to 
the new head of the NAACP, to Reverend Jackson, and to several 
other people, and then I'll decide where to go from here with 
regard to Los Angeles and the other cities of the country.
	     
	     Q	  Let's talk about what brings you to the 
Pittsburgh area today.  There have been -- I guess there's been a 
lot of discussion on Capitol Hill about your stimulus package.  
You've been locked in a battle with the GOP.  Yesterday, as you 
said earlier in your radio address, you made some moves to break 
that gridlock.  What brings you to Pittsburgh, in particular to 
Allegheny County, in particular to Pennsylvania, with that 
battle?
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, there are two reasons.  First 
of all, Pittsburgh, Allegheny County and Pennsylvania supported 
me in the last election because they wanted a new direction in 
economic policy.  We have passed our overall economic plan; it 
gives the country a very different budget for the next five years 
than we've had in the previous 12.  We reduced the deficit and, 
at the same time, increased investment in jobs and education and 
health care, in the things that will make us a stronger country.
	     
	     But in addition to that, I asked the Congress in the 
short run to spend a little more money, a modest amount of money 
to create another half-million jobs in the next year and a half; 
to try to cut the unemployment rate by a half a percent; but also 
to try to spark job creation in the private sector more.  The 
plan passed the House.  It has the support of a majority of the 
Senate.  At the present time, all the Republican   senators as a 
bloc are filibustering the bill.  That is, they won't let it come 
to a vote.
	     
	     I believe that Senator Specter would like to vote 
for the bill.  And I believe that Senator Dole, the Republican 
leader, has put a lot of pressure on a lot of the Republicans to 
stay hitched.  And they're all saying that this bill increases 
the deficit.  It doesn't.  This bill is well below the spending 
targets that Congress approved, including the Republicans, for 
this year.  This bill is paid for by budget cuts in the next five 
years.  This bill is designed to give a jump-start to the 
economy.  And I must say, a lot of the Republican senators that 
are holding it up, when Mr. Bush was President, voted for 
billions of dollars of emergency spending of just this kind --
much of it was totally unrelated to creating jobs.
	     
	     So what I'm trying to do is to break this logjam.  
I've held out an olive branch, I've offered a compromise.  But I 
think that we ought to try to put some more Americans to work 
right now to show that we're changing the direction of the 
country.  And that's the purpose of the bill.
	     
	     Q	  Have you been in touch with Senator Specter or 
his office lately?
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, we've been trying to talk 
regularly to -- through my White House Congressional Liaison 
operation to the senators that we think are open to this --
Senator Specter, Senator D'Amato from New York, Senator Jeffords 
from Vermont, Senator Hatfield from Oregon, and five or six 
others whom we believe know we need more jobs in this economy and 
know that we are paying for this with budget cuts over the life 
of the budget I presented.
	     
	     You know, it has a lot of appeal to say, well, we've 
got a big deficit, we shouldn't increase it more.  But the truth 
is that we are paying for this with budget cuts in the whole life 
of the budget over the next few years.  And more importantly, we 
have this program well below the spending targets that Congress 
has already approved for this year.  And they've done this for 
years, with the Republicans voting for it -- many Republicans 
voting for it -- for things that weren't nearly as important as 
putting the American people back to work.  
	     
	     So I just hope that this doesn't become a political 
issue.  It ought to just be about the people of this country and 
the need for jobs.
	     
	     Q	  I have some questions from people who supported 
you, and some people who are skeptical about your administration.  
It has to do with their hopes, and also with their fears.  A lot 
of people who supported you and voted for you in Pennsylvania --I 
think some of them are now saying, we're glad we got him in the 
White House, but now look at this incredible process he has to go 
through.  Look at these problems.  Look at this gridlock.  And 
they're beginning to wonder, is this going to work; can you pull 
it off?  And, of course, your skeptics are saying, well, I knew 
it was going to be like this.
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, what I would -- I'd ask 
people, first of all, to remember that we are, frankly, moving 
very fast.  The budget resolution that the Congress passed is the 
fastest they have ever passed a budget resolution -- ever -- in 
history, setting out the next five-year budget targets.  So we 
are moving really rapidly.  And we've got them working on 
political reform, welfare reform, health care reform, a whole 
wide range of things.  
	     
	     But it's a big operation.  You can't expect to turn 
it around overnight.  It took 12 years to produce the conditions 
which led to the victory I received from the people in November, 
and we can't turn it around in 90 days.  But I think we're making 
real, real progress.  
	     
	     I would urge the people not to get discouraged.  
We're not going to win every battle, and not everything is going 
to happen overnight.  But we are definitely moving and changing 
things.
	     
	     Q	  Thank you very much.  
	     
	     The President of the United States, Bill Clinton, 
here live at Pittsburgh International Airport.  I'm Mike Whitely, 
KDKA News.

I have had this happen to me often enough that I always look for it.
On my ride to work in the morning I come to a stop light where there are
3 lanes in my direction.  One for left turns, one for straight through, and
one for right turns.  All clearly marked.  Plus there is a clearly marked 
bicycle lane.  I ride into the right turn lane with my signal on and stop at 
the stop line.  Looking left to see if I can make a "right turn on red" and
when I start to move discovered that some idiot has pulled into the bike
lane and is trying to pass me on the right.  GRRR.
   I always do a head check on bike lanes.  Not always for bicycles. . .

	Without having a complete answer to this question,  I should think
it obvious that the first step should be to convince people this would be

the command economies of eastern Europe failed due to corruption rather than
essential weaknesses of caommand economies,  and you still have a majority
in this nation that favors keeping unenforced and unenforcible laws on

I fail to see why you should feel this way in the first place.  Constant

they tend to get invaded before they can come to anything like a stable
society anyway.

Umm, is there any distinction between "vague" and "elastic" in this
context aside from one having a more positive connotation than the other?

At any rate,  we've been through all this before.

You may change that to 100% certainty.  But to clarify, Spacewatch is a
University of Arizona project using a telescope of the Steward Observatory
located on Kitt Peak.  It is not associated with Kitt Peak National
Observatory, other than sharing a mountain.

1) So what?

2) It will be interesting to see the reaction when 2.5million queers
   gather in Washington DC. After all if there are only 6million of
   us then this is an event unprecidented in history...

Christians through ages have had to learn to be patient. I do think
it's time to face the reality. The events during the last 52 two
days showed what the world is really like.

Hmmmm....  The prefix "peri-" is Greek, not Latin, so it's usually used
with the Greek form of the name of the body being orbited.  (That's why
it's "perihelion" rather than "perisol", "perigee" rather than "periterr",
and "pericynthion" rather than "perilune".)  So for Jupiter I'd expect it
to be something like "perizeon".)   :^)

    This series of linked messages is periodically posted to the Usenet
groups sci.space and sci.astro in an attempt to provide good answers to
frequently asked questions and other reference material which is worth
preserving. If you have corrections or answers to other frequently asked
questions that you would like included in this posting, send email to
leech@cs.unc.edu (Jon Leech).

    If you don't want to see the FAQ, add 'Frequently Asked Questions' to
your KILL file for this group (if you're not reading this with a newsreader
that can kill articles by subject, you're out of luck).

    The FAQ volume is excessive right now and will hopefully be trimmed down
by rewriting and condensing over time. The FAQ postings are available in
the Ames SPACE archive in FAQ/faq<#>.

    Good summaries will be accepted in place of the answers given here. The
point of this is to circulate existing information, and avoid rehashing old
answers. Better to build on top than start again. Nothing more depressing
than rehashing old topics for the 100th time. References are provided
because they give more complete information than any short generalization.

    Questions fall into three basic types:

    1) Where do I find some information about space?

    Try your local public library first. The net is not a good place to ask
    for general information. Ask INDIVIDUALS (by email) if you must. There
    are other sources, use them, too. The net is a place for open ended
    discussion.

    2) I have an idea which would improve space flight?

    Hope you aren't surprised, but 9,999 out of 10,000 have usually been
    thought of before. Again, contact a direct individual source for
    evaluation. NASA fields thousands of these each day.

    3) Miscellanous queries.

    These are addressed on a case-by-case basis in the following series of
    FAQ postings.


    SUGGESTIONS FOR BETTER NETIQUETTE

    Read news.announce.newusers if you're on Usenet.
    Minimize cross references, [Do you REALLY NEED to?]
    Edit "Subject:" lines, especially if you're taking a tangent.
    Send mail instead, avoid posting follow ups. (1 mail message worth
	100 posts).
    Internet mail readers: send requests to add/drop to SPACE-REQUEST
	not SPACE.
    Read all available articles before posting a follow-up. (Check all
	references.)
    Cut down attributed articles (leave only the points you're
	responding to; remove signatures and headers). Summarize!
    Put a return address in the body (signature) of your message (mail
	or article), state your institution, etc. Don't assume the
	'reply' function of mailers will work.
    Use absolute dates. Post in a timely way. Don't post what everyone
	will get on TV anyway.
    Some editors and window systems do character count line wrapping:
	keep lines under 80 characters for those using ASCII terminals
	(use carriage returns).

NEXT: FAQ #2/15 - Network Resources



There has been a lot of discussion about Tyre.  In sum, Ezekiel prophesied
that the place would be mashed and never rebuilt; as there are a lot of
people living there, it would appear that Ezekiel was not literally correct.

This doesn't bother me at all, because I understand the language Ezekiel used
differently than do so-called Biblical literalists.  For example, it sometimes
happens that someone says "My grandson is the cutest baby!" and then turns
around and sees the granddaughter and says "Oh!  Isn't she the cutest thing!?"

This person is not literally claiming to have lined up all the babies in the
world according to cuteness and discovered his own grandchildren tied for
first.  Rather, he is trying to express his emotions using words that are very
object-oriented.  Because this example is one that is common to many people,
nobody misunderstands the intent of the statements; the Bible, however, is
often at the mercy of people who assume that everything within must be exactly
literally true.  For those people, the existence of Tyre is a problem; for me,
it is not.


Turning to the latest person trying to defend Ezekiel, we read this from
John E King:

> The prophesy clearly implies that people would still be living in the
> area[.]

No, it implies nothing of the kind.  If you had nothing but the prophecy from
Ezekiel, and you were told you interpret it literally, you would never say
"Oh, he means that there will be houses and businesses and plants and stuff
like that."  You would read "I will make you a bare rock" and "You will never
be rebuilt", and you'd conclude that Tyre would be a bare rock.  The only way
to get from `fishing nets' to `houses and buildings and a medium-large
population' is if you KNOW that all that latter stuff is there.

In other words, your answer means that Ezekiel misled everybody who read the
prophecy at the time it was written.  There is no way that, given a literal
reading, they could read this passage and conclude "medium-size city".

You seem to feel that "Never be rebuilt" means "be rebuilt" -- maybe so, but
it is hardly a `clear implication'.


Mr King also writes:

> So far I've seen stated figurers ranging from 15,000 to 22,000.
> Let's assume the latter one is correct.  By modern standards
> we are talking about a one-horse town.

Well, no.  That's only a bit less than the population of Annapolis, where I'm
from.  You know, the Naval Acadamy, the state capital, George Washington
resigned his commission in the statehouse?  Annapolis may not be New York, but
it's at least a two-horse town.

But supposing 22,000 people is a "small town" -- it's still 22,000 people
MORE than Ezekiel predicted.


And you've said nothing about the other problem.  In chapter 26, Ezekiel
predicts that Nebuchadnezzar will will destroy Tyre and loot all their
valuables.  However, Nebuchadnezzar did NOT destroy Tyre, and in chapter 29
Ezekiel even quotes God as saying "he and his army got no reward from the
campaign he led against Tyre."

Let's ignore Alexander for a moment, and just pay attention to chapter 26.
Ezekiel says N. would destroy Tyre, and N. did NOT destroy Tyre.  Ezekiel says
that N. would plunder their valuables, but N. did NOT plunder their valuables.

Regardless of what you think about Tyre _now_, the fact is that N. died before
the place was destroyed.  Ezekiel said N. was going to do it, and N. did not.

 *

This post is, of course, pointless.  Inerrantists have an amazing ability
to rewrite the Bible as needed to fit whatever they want it to say.

For example, I expect Mr King to respond to the comments about Ezekiel 26
by pulling some "clear implications" out of hat.

When Ezekiel said that N. would "demolish your towers", that clearly implied
that the walls would still be standing so people would know where the towers
used to be.  And when Ezekiel said that N. would "demolish your fine houses
and throw your stones, timber and rubble into the sea", that clearly implied
that N. would never set foot on the island.  And when Ezekiel wrote that N.
would "build a ramp up to your walls", that clearly implies that N. would
spend 13 years stomping around on the mainland and never get close to the
walls.

See?  A few "clear implications" that are totally contrary to the text, and
you can reconcile anything you want.

I'm looking for a sport-cruiser - factory installed fairings (
full/half ), hard saddle bags, 750cc and above, and all that and still
has that sporty look.

I particularly like the R100RS and K75 RT or S, or any of the K series
BMW bikes.

I was wondering if there are any other comparable type bikes being
produced by companies other than BMW.

Thanks for the info,
Jae

OK, I admit I have no hard data on this. Why don't you help me with this?
If you would compile a commented list of all grants, un-repaid loans (if any),
and direct aid, I'd be very interested to see it. If you could give me
references from, for example, Congressional Budget Authorization Hearings,
I could look them up here and I'd be happy to post a verification of your
data.

Otherwise, I'll try my hand at this, but unfortunately I won't have sufficient
time available until the end of this month, so the results would be delayed.

Let me know if you're interested in doing this.

Some Christians take a 10% discount off the Ten Commandments.  Sunday
cannot be substituted for the Sabbath.

Since your MOSFET is a 1972 vintage, it's probably not a very good one by 
today's standards.  If you have an idea about its voltage and current 
ratings, e.g. 60VDC @ 6A, you can probably get away with replacing it with 
anything with better specs.  Early MOSFETS had a gate-source voltage rating 
of approximately +/- 20 VDCmax, and they would usually turn completely "ON" 
at +10VDC.  Otherwise, MOSFETS are not really mysterious -- they're more or 
less voltage controlled current sources.  If the MOSFET in your circuit is 
used as an open-loop, voltage controlled current source, you may have to 
experiment with various gain-altering techniques.

I would just like to point out that it is much easier to place an
object at orbital altitude than it is to place it with orbital
velocity.  For a target 300 km above the surface of Earth,
you need a delta-v of 2.5 km/s.  Assuming that rockets with specific
impulses of 300 seconds are easy to produce, a rocket with a dry
weight of 50 kg would require only about 65 kg of fuel+oxidizer.
A small dispersal charge embedded in about 20 kg of sand or
birdshot (depending on the nature of the structure) would be
the payload.  I am sure the whole project is well within
the capability of the amateur rocketry community.

It sounds like a good Science Fair project--'Reduction
of Light Pollution Through Applied Ballistics'.
Or, it could be part of the Challenge Prize being discussed
here: $1 billion for the first person to spend 1 year
on the moon, $1 million for the first erradication of
an orbital eyesore/CCD burner.  I wouldpledge $1000
for the first person to bring it down, and I am sure
there are at least 999 other astronomers, nature lovers,
or just plain people of good taste who would do likewise.

Of course, a  Gerald Bull solution might be simpler.
(Either the solution Gerald Bull would apply--the use
of a large caliber gun; or the solution which was applied
to Gerald Bull--the use of a small caliber gun.)

First I've heard of it. Offhand:

Griffin is no longer an "office" head, so that's bad.

On the other hand:

Regress seemed to think: we can't fund anything by Griffin, because
that would mean (and we have the lies by the old hardliners about the
$ 400 billion mars mission to prove it) that we would be buying into a
mission to Mars that would cost 400 billion. Therefore there will be
no Artemis or 20 million dollar lunar orbiter et cetera...

They were killing Griffin's main program simply because some sycophants
somewhere had Congress beleivin that to do so would simply be to buy into
the same old stuff. Sorta like not giving aid to Yeltsin because he's
a communist hardliner.

At least now the sort of reforms Griffin was trying to bring forward

I generally find that after two or three decent hits of nitrous, my riding

The NASM photo archives are open to the public.  All (or almost all)

This tactic depends for its effectiveness on the dog's conformance to
a "psychological norm" that may not actually apply to a particular dog.
I've tried it with some success before, but it won't work on a Charlie Manson
dog or one that's really, *really* stupid.  A large Irish Setter taught me
this in *my* yard (apparently HIS territory) one day.  I'm sure he was playing 
a game with me.  The game was probably "Kill the VERY ANGRY Neighbor" Before

Where does it say in the bible that Christians are supposed to persecute
Jews?  Isn't it love your enemies instead?  They may say they are "Christian"
but do their actions speak differently?  Do you believe what everyone tells
you?  I don't.  I came to believe in God by my own investigation and conclusions.
And ultimately by my own choice.  Salvation, however, was granted only through
the grace of God.

To be a Christian is to model oneself after Jesus Christ as implied by the
very name Christian.  If you say you believe in your head but do not feel in
your heart, what does that say of your belief?

|> White Supremisists and
|> Neo-Nazis may not be your brand of Christian, but by believing in Christ,

White supremists and Neo-Nazis are NOT any brand of Christian.

"If you hate your whom you can see then how can you love God whom you cannot
 see?"

What does this belief entail?  Believing in Christ and having your sins
forgiven in His name does NOT give a Christian a free licence to sin.  To
repent of a sin is to ask forgiveness of that sin and TRY NOT to do it
again.  I am a Christian, but if you lump me in with racists and accuse me
of being such, then are you not pre-judging me?  BTW, I am of Chinese racial
background and I know what it is to be part of a visible minority in this
country.  I don't think that I would be favourably looked upon by these
White supremist "Christians" as you call them.

Anyone can say what they believe, but if they don't practice what they preach,
then their belief is false.  Do you concur?

Nazis and racists in general are the ones that come to my immediate attention.
What I believe is that such people may be using the bible to mask their racial
intolerance and bigotry.  They can do as they do and hide behind Christianity
but I tell you that Jesus would have nothing to do with them.

The only point I'm trying to make is that those who call themselves Christian
may not be Christian.  I ask that you draw your own conclusions by what they
do and what they say.  If they are not modelled after the example of Jesus
Christ then they are NOT Christian.  If they have not repented of their sins
and accepted Jesus Christ as their personal Lord and Saviour then they are 
NOT Christian.  These are the only criteria to being a Christian.

May God be with you,

Malcolm Lee   :)

Unfortunately, if you launch this from the US (or are a US citizen),
you will need a launch permit from the Office of Commercial Space
Transportation, and I think it may be difficult to get a permit for
an antisatellite weapon... :-)

The threshold at which OCST licensing kicks in is roughly 100km.

Here is a way to get the commericial companies into space and mineral
exploration.

Basically get the eci-freaks to make it so hard to get the minerals on earth..
You think this is crazy. Well in a way it is, but in a way it is reality.

There is a billin the congress to do just that.. Basically to make it so
expensive to mine minerals in the US, unless you can by off the inspectors or
tax collectors.. ascially what I understand from talking to a few miner friends 
of mine, that they (the congress) propose to have a tax on the gross income of
the mine, versus the adjusted income, also the state governments have there
normal taxes. So by the time you get done, paying for materials, workers, and
other expenses you can owe more than what you made.
BAsically if you make a 1000.00 and spend 500. ofor expenses, you can owe
600.00 in federal taxes.. Bascially it is driving the miners off the land.. And
the only peopel who benefit are the eco-freaks.. 

Basically to get back to my beginning statement, is space is the way to go
cause it might just get to expensive to mine on earth because of either the
eco-freaks or the protectionist.. 
Such fun we have in these interesting times..

The gravity maneuvering that was used was to exploit 'fuzzy regions'.  These
are described by the inventor as exploiting the second-order perturbations in a
three body system.  The probe was launched into this region for the
earth-moon-sun system, where the perturbations affected it in such a way as to
allow it to go into lunar orbit without large expenditures of fuel to slow
down. The idea is that 'natural objects sometimes get captured without
expending fuel, we'll just find the trajectory that makes it possible". The
originator of the technique said that NASA wasn't interested, but that Japan
was because their probe was small and couldn't hold a lot of fuel for
deceleration.

	This from an issue of 'Science News' or 'The Planetary Report' I
believe, about 2 months ago(?).

Their Hiten engineering-test mission spent a while in a highly eccentric
Earth orbit doing lunar flybys, and then was inserted into lunar orbit
using some very tricky gravity-assist-like maneuvering.  This meant that
it would crash on the Moon eventually, since there is no such thing as

And I maintain:

Some people do not want to enter into the light and the knowledge that
they alone are their own masters, because they fear it; they are too
afraid of having to face the world on their own terms.  And so, by
their own choice, they will remain in darkness, sort of like bugs
under a rock.  However, some people, but not many, will not like the
darkness.  Sometimes it gets too cold and too dark to be comfortable.
These people will crawl out from under the rock, and, although blinded
at first, will get accustomed to the light and enjoy its warmth.  And,
after a while, now that they can see things for what they really are,
they will also see the heights which they can reach, and the places
they can go, and they will learn to choose their own paths through the
world, and they will learn from their mistakes and revel in their
successes.

They will see that there is much much more to the world than just the
narrow experiences under the rock.  They will discover that life under
a rock was incredibly yucky, and that life on their own terms is great
-- so great that they will want to tell everyone else about it.

Do you see my point?  I think you're the one under the rock, and I'm
getting a great tan out here in the sunlight.  My life has improved
immesurably since I abandoned theism -- come and join me!  It will be
a difficult trip at first, until you build up your muscles for the
long hike, but it's well worth it!

Look, you just practically equated Odin and Zeus?  They're as much

Nope -- most people are Christian.  Most people are fond of feeling
that they are imperfect, of believing that the world is an undesirable
place, of reciting magical mystical prayers to make the world nice and
holy again, of doing just as their priests tell them, like good little
sheep.  You enjoy darkness, and you're proud of it.

You may know the Bible well -- but have you read any of the Koran?  Or
Zen writings?  Or Hare Krishna literature?  If you haven't, then how
can you say you have an open mind?

Nope.  You make decisions, enjoy your successes, and accept your
failures; then you die.  If you are content with the life you've led
as you reflect back on it in your final moments, then you've led a
good life.

I'm sorry, I don't feel that sacrificing Jesus was something any god
I'd worship would do, unless the sacrifice was only temporary, in
which case it's not really all that important.

Forget the Bible for a minute.  Forget quoting verses, forget about
who said what about this or that.  *Show me.*  Picture just you and me
and a wide open hilltop, and convince me that you're right.

I'm afraid that I've lost the thread here.  I didn't suggest that all 
government regulations be subject to referenda.  So I don't follow the

I mean that an ideology that treats all government regulation as equally
undesirable and seeks to abolish all regulations is unlikely to draw
support among more than a miniscule portion of the electorate.

Furthermore, I am suggesting that such a plan is not feasible in an
industrial society because the weight of litigation and/or misery it
would produce would effectively crush productive effort.

No, I'm not surprised.  I just think it's interesting that on one hand
libertarians assume a limited government can be decreed, yet on the other
posit an entire government made up of people who carry guns.  (I realize
that many libertarians assume that such a government will be 
counterbalanced by a fully armed citizenry, but it is worth noting that
widespread civilian ownership of guns does not necessarily prevent the
establishment of totalitarian government, e.g. Iraq.)

Yup, sure do.  But since I also support the constitutional requirement

I'm willing to justify such programs on that basis.

Well, in the first place, I don't support a "socialized economic system."
I think within limits that capitalism is a fine idea.  But it is not
the case that "any third party...is...as likely to be ignorant or corrupt
as the buyer or seller."  There are multitudes of examples where such a
statement is demonstrably false.  Regulation of stock market transactions
that provide a reasonable basis for buyers to avoid fraud is only one
example.

Bubblejets often splatter a little bit, whereas LaserJets (given half-way decent
toner, like HP's "Microfine" stuff) don't.  Both produce very good output,
but you don't have to look too closely at the two to tell that LaserJet
output is definitely superior.  

On the other hand, LaserJets which haven't been maintained properly and use
the cheapest toner the owner could find often produce awful output, much
worse than a bubblejet. :-)

One other thing... there are bubblejets, and then there are BubbleJets.
There are a few bubblejets out there that produce rather mediocre output
(such as HP's dinky little BubbleJet), whereas most produce really good
looking output (such as HP's DeskJets).  IBM and Canon both produce some of
the really good style bubblejets.

P.S. -- If you're in the market for a portable bublejet printer, I can
highly recommend the HP Portable DeskJet, although I've heard the portable
Canons are good too (I needed PCL support, myself).  With the DeskJet
Portable, you even get an undocumented PCMCIA card slot!

No, and Im especially unhappy that these 70+ people died in an assault

I am also unhappy (or actually, very suspicious) that the FBI was dismissing

It is obvious that Mr. Cramer has the 'ability' to take the 'leap of faith'.
I have listened to several of the men involved in this study, and even they
claim that the men involved will not 'tell the whole truth'.

I put little value in extrapolating from these types of 'studies' or 'surveys',
they have limited subsets of individuals, and there is alot of skewing due
to improper selection methods, and the bias of the people involved in the
studies on both sides- subject and researcher.

Would you admit to be part of a group that was not very well liked?  Would 
you admit to having had sex with other people at some considered abnormal
rate (this applies to heterosexual men).  In fact, as one gay man and one
straight man put it, "men lie about the number of partners, because that's
the thing to do"- our culture for the male almost requires this type of
response.  It may seem harmless and silly, but carries a large emotional
and mental price tag.

I hear college male students everyday talking about their 'supposed' 
conquest.  They just have to look good to one another, at least in their
eyes.  But also know that alot of this does go on, there are many college
males (hetero) having a lot of sex with different partners.

Bill, I have taken the time to explain that biblical scholars consider the
Josephus reference to be an early Christian insert.  By biblical scholar I mean
an expert who, in the course of his or her research, is willing to let the
chips fall where they may.  This excludes literalists, who may otherwise be
defined as biblical apologists.  They find what they want to find.  They are
not trustworthy by scholarly standards (and others).

Why an insert?  Read it - I have, a number of times.  The passage is glaringly
out of context, and Josephus, a superb writer, had no such problem elsewhere 
in his work.  The passage has *nothing* to do with the subject matter in which 
it lies.  It suddenly appears and then just as quickly disappears.

Until you can demonstrate how and why the scholarly community is wrong about
the Josephus insert, your "proof" is meaningless and it should not be repeated
here.  What's more, even if Josephus happened to be legitimate, it would "prove"
nothing.  Scholars speak of the "weight of evidence."  Far more independent
evidence would be required to validate your claim.  Until forthcoming, your
belief is based on faith.  That's OK, but you exceed your rights when you pass
faith off as fact.

As for the gospels, there are parallels, but there are also glaring
inconsistencies and contradictions.  Shouldn't a perfect canon be perfect? 
Shouldn't there be absolutely no room for debate?  I suggest you read _Gospel 
Fictions_ by Randel Helms, and _The Unauthorized Version_ by Robin Fox (for 
Herb Huston, no known kinship or familial relationship, but we do indeed share 
an evolutionary ancestry).

The fact that there are inconsistencies, gaps and contradictions does not deny
your position.  On the other hand, neither do the gospels "prove" your faith. 
Independent evidence is necessary, and I know of none (which we have already
discussed, and so far you have not provided any).  Until then, its faith. 
Moreover, you have committed a fundamental error in logic.  You have attempted
to "prove" your claim with that which you want to prove.  Its no different than
saying "I am right because I say so."  

Your logic is full of circles.  It reminds me a bit of the 1910 Presbyterian 
General Assembly.  The assembly defined five fundamentals (this is where
"fundamentalist" came from) of orthodox Protestant Christianity, to wit: 1)
Jesus performed miracles, 2) Jesus was born of a virgin, 3) Jesus was bodily
resurrected, 4) Jesus' crucifixion atoned for human sin, and - here is the
clincher - 5) the bible is the inerrant word of God.  Presbyterians construe
"inerrant" broadly as spritually inerrant.  Fundamentalists take the
first four as literally true, and then validate them with a literally inerrant
bible, which contains the first four, and which is the only thing known to 
contain the first four.  

Smoke and mirrors and wands and hand waving if ever there was!

Its faith, Bill.  You don't have any more or better truths than anyone else. 
Whatever works for you.  Just don't foist it on others. 

Regards,

Rich Fox, Anthro, Usouthdakota

I don't understand what you are getting at here.  If the chances of 
promiscuity are larger, yet the rate of promiscuity is lower in the heterosexual
community, doesn't that imply that the homo/bi sexual population is then 
even more promiscuous than the raw statistics imply?  
(No axe to grind here I'm just a scientist and I hate to see statistics abused.)

I am a hetero man and have had sex with one woman in my life (my wife).  It is 
very pleasing to me to be able to say that.  I hope you have the same feeling
as I do.  I also wish that you could (if you wanted) experience the joys and
trials of being committed to someone for life (there is something about marriage
that makes the commitment much greater than one might expect).

Don't forget about the culture.  Sadly, we don't (as a society) look upon
homosexuality as normal (and as we are all too well aware, there are alot
of people who condemn it).  As a result, the gay population is not encouraged
to develop "non-promiscuous" relationships.  In fact there are many roadblocks
put in the way of such committed relationships.  It is as if the heterosexual
community puts these blocks there so as to perpetuate the claim that gays 
are immoral.  "My, if we allowed gays to marry, raise children ... we might
just find out they're as moral as we are, can't have that can we?" 

Just some thoughts.  Flame away. :)

It depends on the bike. Once you've found a bike you're interested in, call
some insurance companies for rates. Some bikes are much cheaper to insure than
you might think (my EX-500 only costs me $127/year in St. Louis; I'm 27)

>3)  Any recommendations on what I should buy/where I should look for it?

For a first bike, I recommend 500cc's or less. And a bike short enough to get
both feet on the ground when you stop.
 
The one piece of advice EVERYONE will give you is to take a Motorcycle Safety
Foundation Rider's Course. See a dealer for details. In some states, completion
of such a course can give you a break on insurance. It will also teach you
to ride properly from the beginning, so you won't learn any bad habits.

Good luck. Riding a motorcycle is the most fun you can have, naked or otherwise.

Yes, the Phobos mission did return some useful data including images of Phobos
itself. The best I've seen had a surface resolution of about 40 meters. By
the way, the new book entitled "Mars" (Kieffer et al, 1992, University of
Arizona Press) has a great chapter on spacecraft exploration of the planet.
The chapter is co-authored by V.I. Moroz of the Space Research Institute in
Moscow, and includes details never before published in the West. Don't
know of any ftp sites with images though.

A related question (which I haven't given that much serious thought 
to): at what lattitude is the average length of the day (averaged 
over the whole year) maximized? Is this function a constant=
12 hours? Is it truly symmetric about the equator? Or is
there some discrepancy due to the fact that the orbit is elliptic
(or maybe the difference is enough to change the temperature and
make the seasons in the southern hemisphere more bitter, but
is far too small to make a sizeable difference in daylight
hours)?

I want to know where to move.

Of course it is.  It forms a very big part of your self-respect.  You come onto 
the board, thinking you're some sort of apologeticist for your faith, and you
routinely get roasted over a grill for stupid theories and unfounded assumptions.

I doubt that Sieferman has anything to do with you dropping out.  

It's probably closer to the truth to say that you don't have the cards to 
play in this game (because you insist on playing from a losing hand), and you're
finally realizing it.  You will lurk on the board, and keep 
quiet for a while, looking for an area where you are *certain* that you 
are correct, and then we'll see you pop back in again.  Of course, you then
will say that you have merely returned because your life is now "in order".

But we'll know better.

Look for a happier-looking KZ440?

Suzuki used to have an L designation, for example my former boss had a
GS850L which had a seat a couple inches lower than the "regular"
GS850, but it was certainly no cruiser.

This will be a hard task, because most cultures used most animals
for blood sacrifices. It has to be something related to our current
post-modernism state. Hmm, what about used computers?

Lot's of these small miners  are no longer miners.  THey are people living
rent free on Federal land,  under the claim of being a miner.  The facts are
many of these people do not sustaint heir income from mining,  do not
often even live their full time,  and do fotentimes do a fair bit
of environmental damage.

These minign statutes were created inthe 1830's-1870's  when the west was
uninhabited  and were designed to bring people into the frontier.  Times change
people change.  DEAL.  you don't have a constitutional right to live off
the same industry forever.  Anyone who claims the have a right to their
job in particular,  is spouting nonsense.   THis has been a long term
federal welfare program,  that has outlived it's usefulness.

Actually, what the study shows is that 2 percent of the men surveyed
*said* they engaged in homosexual sex and 1 percent *said* they 
considered themselves exclusively homosexual.

The point being that what people say and what they acutally do
may be different.

It is interesting that this clip from the newspaper did not
mention that difference.  Maybe it is conservative media bias.  :-)

On the other hand, it would be kind of scary if there were *never* a final
verdict, because a party to litigation could keep saying "Oops!  I forgot
to bring up this evidence," and demand a new trial.  You get one bite at
the apple.

It's up to General Motors to find those witnesses in the first litigation.
You'd be up in arms if a plaintiff suing General Motors pulled the same
stunt and made them relitigate an issue that they already lost.  It's not
as if General Motors couldn't file enough discovery motions to delay the
trial until they found all the witnesses they wanted.

Define "obvious bias."

>Shouldn't that be enough for
>a judge to through out the old verdict and call for a new trial?

Did GM move for a new trial on those grounds?  No?  Perhaps they had a 
reason?

I've been thinking of sending into Mad magazine an idea for a 
parody, of those books entitled "How Things Work" that
engineers buy their sons, which explain how engines, elevators,
flourescent lights, etc. work.

The parody would be "How Things Really Work."  Under "Canned
Food", on the left page you'd see the description from 
"How Things Work": gleaming stainless steel equipment
pasteurizing the food to precisely the right temperature,
then sealing the can in an oxygen-free environment, etc.

On the right page you'd see "How Things Really Work":
brain-dead workers sending disgusting food to the
gleaming equipment -- rotting vegetables, parts of
animals people don't eat, barrels of sugar and chemicals.

Under "Elevators" you'd see (on the left) computer geniuses
working out algorithms so that X number of people
waiting for Y elevators will get to Z floors in the shortest
time.  On the right, you'd see giggling elevator controllers
behind a one-way mirror in the lobby choosing which people
appear to be in the biggest hurry and making them wait longest.

  Up to this point, I was kinda hoping that this was a joke. Still,
it would make a great premise for a bad syndicated TV show- "These

  No doubt I've just horribly offended someone.

It may be "irrelevant" to you and *your* personal beliefs (or should I say

bottom line IS truth," independant from you or anyone else.  Since you
proclaim "truths" as a self-proclaimed appointee, may I ask you by what
authority you do this?  Because "it says so in the Bible?"  --Does the
Bible "say so," or is it YOU, or someone else, who interprets whether a
scripture or doctrine conforms to your particular liking or "disapproval"?

Excuse moi, but your line of "truths" haven't moved me one bit to persuade
me that my beliefs are erroneous.  Of all the "preachers" of "truth" on
this net, you have struck me as a self-righteous member of the wrecking
crew, with no positive message to me or other latter-day saints whatsoever.
BTW, this entire discussion reminds me a lot of the things said by Jesus
to the pharisees: "ye hypocrite(s) . . . ye preach about me with your lips,
but your hearts are far removed from me..."

Sophistry.  Look who's talking: "jumping to conclusions?"  You wouldn't do
that yourself, right?  All YOU address is your own convictions, regardless
whether we come up with any Biblical scriptures which supports our points
of view, because you reject such interpretations without any consideration
whatsoever.

Correction: it may contradict would YOU think the Bible says.  The Bible
indeed does teach that not all are children of God in the sense that they
"belong to" or follow God in His footsteps.  Satan and his followers have
rebelled against God, and are not "children (=followers/redeemed) of God,"
but it doesn't mean that they were not once created by God, but chose to
separate themselves from those who chose to follow God and His plan of
salvation.

So?  --This illustrates nicely what I just said: the children of the

In this single posting of yours, I've seen more "constructs of imagination"
than in all of the pro-lds mails combined I have read so far in this news
group.  First get your lds-facts straight before you dare preaching to us
about "the only true God," whom you interpret according to your own likes
and dislikes, but whose image I cannot reconcile with what I know about
Him myself.  I guess your grandiose self-image does not allow for other
faiths, believing in the divinity of Jesus Christ, but in a different
way or fashion than your own.  Not that it really matters, the mission
and progress of the lds church will go on, boldly and nobly, and no mob
or opponent can stop the work from progressing, until it has visited
every continent, swept every clime, and sounded in every ear.

#  This is really a red herring. It doesn't address any issue raised, but

Sigh.  "What the Bible teaches"?  Or: "what the bible teaches according to
Robert Weiss and co.?"  I respect the former, I reject the latter without
the remotest feeling that I have rejected Jesus.  On the contrary.  And by
the way, I do respect your interpretations of the Bible, I even grant you
being a Christian (following your own image of Him), as much as I am a
Christian (following my own image of Him in my heart).

The issue is, of course, that you love to use anything to either mis-

is obviously very important.  McConkie's views have been controversial
(e.g. "The Seven Deadly Heresies" has made me a heretic!  ;-) at best,
or erroneous at worst ("blacks not to receive the priesthood in this
dispensation").  I respect him as someone who has made his valuable
contribution to the church, but I personally do NOT rely on his personal
interpretations (his book "Mormon Doctrine" is oftentimes referred to
as "McConkie's Bible" in mormon circles) on mormon doctrine.  I rather
look to official (doctrinal) sources, and... to Hugh Nibley's books!
(The last comment is an lds-insider reference.)  Summarizing: McConkie
was a wise man who contributed undoubtedly far more to the kingdom of
God than I have, but whose views are by no means dogma or accepted
doctrine, some of it clearly belongs to personal interpretation and
speculation.  But having said this, I find McConkie (even in his most
biased and speculative moments) far more thought-provoking than the
trash coming from your proverbial pen.  I'm somewhat appalled that I have
allowed myself to sink as low as you in this posting...

First of all as far as I know, only male homosexuality is explicitly
mentioned in the bibles, so you're off the hook there, I think. In
any event, there are *plenty* of people in many denominations who
do not consider a person's sexual identification of gay/lesbian/bisexual
as an "immoral lifestyle choice"

This is another misconception. You are not being told the whole story.

My former minister is a lesbian, and I know personally and
professionally several openly gay and lesbian ministers. I am
a Unitarian-Universalist and like most others in my denomination,
am pro-choice. You needn't go looking to the Unitarian Universalists
(which is a liberal religion) for acceptance of your sexual
identification and pro-choice views, however; there are many of us
who believe in spirituality AND freedom of conscience.

Good Luck on your journey!

I think you posted your article 15 days too late :-)) April 1st is over.
I don't like nuclear powerplants but i think it's not fair to tell such
"storys" about them. OK ?
Let me try to explain what that tower is used to:
   -1st. Even the modernst nuclear powerplant is only a simple steam-engine.
         It has an hightech "boiler" but the rest is still verry verry 
         conventional. And if you've already visited any condensation-
         powerstation you'l have seen the cooling towers too.
         If you look at any good book about thermophysics you'll find
         a chapter about the "CARNOT-process" which describes how to
         get energy from a temperature difference ! And that is the reason
         for cooling towers too !!! You only can get energy if you've an
         temperature gradient. That means that you have steam on the one 
         side and need to cool down the steam 'till you get water
         again on the other side if you want to get aprox. 30% of the 
         energy you (or better the uranium) brought into the water to
         let it boil. If you only have hot steam on the one and "cold"
         steam on the other side you'll loose much more of the energy.
         And so they cool down the steam to get at least the 30% of
         energy that carnot will give them.
         The cooling towers are for cooling the steam !
         The vapor you'll see is NOT the steam of the main core circulation,
         because that steam is radioactive ! The circulation is divided in
         AT LEAST 2 circuits connected about heat exchangers to prevent
         radioactive pollution of the environment !
         
   -2nd. OK, the main core IS hot, but even in the modernst HighTemperature-
         Reactors (HTR) they only run at ~800 deg celsius. This is still
         verry far away from uraniums melting point which is somewhere
         around 2000 deg. celsius ! But you'll have lot's of problems with
         the boiler's steel. That's because at this temperature the
         metal is attacked by steam and will corrode verry fast.
         This is only for BWR's. The new He cooled reactors have temperatures
         up to 1200 deg. celsius. But this is only experimental. 

   -3rd. I personaly think that nuclear waste should be as low as ever
         possible because the dose you get will accumulate about the
         years. Today 1 mRem and next year 0.5 mRem won't be 0.75 mRem
         at all. It accumulates and even in 80 years you'll still have
         1.5 mRem. And i'm not interested in glowing in the night and
         getting children with 2 heads. This is my point of view.

I can tell you that when AMSAT launched some birds along a Spot satellite
(French), that during installation of some instruments on Spot 2, there
heavily armed legionaires who had a `take no prisoners' look on there faces.
Spot satellites are completely capable of doing some very good on orbit
surveillance.

I want people to be able to get the things they need in life.  Property
ownership may not be ideal, but it is far better at letting people get
what they need to live a productive, fulfulling life.

The first experiment in America, where property ownership was denied,
caused, starvation, hunger, and death.  Few people know that the
Pilgrims originally tried to have common property to grow food and a
common food store.  Many people know the hardships they suffered the
first few winters because of it.  After arriving, the Pilgrims made all
property common.  They all shared in the work and the resulting crops
went into a common store.  After much debate the new Governor Bradford
privitized the land; assigning plots to each family.  According to Perry
D. Westbrook:  "The change was immediately justified by the increased
industry of the inhabitants and by the larger acreage planted."

Bradford himself acknowledged this failure of communism.  He wrote:  "The
experience that was had in this common course and condition, tried
sundry years and that amongst godly and sober men, may well evince the
vanity of that conceit of Plato's and other ancients applauded by some of
later times; that the taking away of property and bringing in community into
a commonwealth would make them happy and flourishing; as if they were wiser
than God.  For this community (so far as it was) was found to breed much
confusion and discontent and retard much employment that would have been
to their benefit and comfort."

Bradford did not blame this failure on the "strangers", but on the basic
selfishness in all men.  He wrote "seeing all men have this corruption in
them, God in his wisdom saw another course fitter for them."  In other
words, according to Westbrook, "Bradford found private enterprise to be
the most suitable economic policy for mankind in its fallen state."

Let's not make the same mistake that the Pilgrims made.  Private
property allows a society to flourish, the alternative brings
starvation, poverty and discontent.

Good gravy! Decibels are all *ratios.* The question that remains in
any ratio is the reference unit used. Sometimes, this will be a reference
power, such as 1 milliwatt (given a certain circuit impedance which
should also be included in the fine print or known, like 50 ohms
in an RF circuit of that impedance), leading to an accepted
notation of dBm. Maybe it might be dBV, disregarding the impedance of
the circuit and power developed, using 1 volt as reference *amplitude*
(rather than reference power). Or, it might have an arbitrary or omitted
reference that is not included in the notation, leading to just plain dB.
So. look at it this way--'dB' has an implied reference while notation
such as 'dBm' has an explicit reference.

For power:

  dB = 10*log( P(measured)/P(reference) )

For amplitude

  dB = 20*log( A(measured)/A(reference) )

'B' is for bel, which is a standard term for a log ratio to the base
10, named after Alexander Graham Bell. A 'deci' Bel is 1/10 of a bel.
It has nothing to do with the Bell Telephone company except for
the common founder's name. The small 'd'/large 'B' is per SI notation
convention. I don't know anyone that's been crucified for messing it up.

Common references for audio are:

	0 dBm = 1 milliwatt across 600 ohms
	0 dBV = 1 volt

	0 VU (a zero on the VU meter) = +4 dBm  (pro gear line level)
	0 VU = -10dBV	(consumer gear line level)


Often times, a power amp VU meter will be aligned using
the rated power of the amp as the 0 dB point. It is all
done to whatever reference is reasonable for the application
or moment.

Note that in a circuit with a given (and maybe unknown) linear
impedance, if the amplitude goes up so many decibels, the
power will also increase the same amount. This proof can be done
with the above two identities and ohm's law.

This is *exactly* what the public in France & Italy perceive to be the

Wrong.  This is true perhaps only for the Lega Nord.
The referendum Sunday is expected to establish a British/American style
first-past-the-post system in the Senate.  If implemented, it would
encourage a two- (or perhaps three-) party system in Italy.
Most likely the DC and PSI will not be these parties; rather there will
be a shakeup of the entire party structure from which 2 new parties
will emerge to dominate.  Will Lega Nord be one of these?  Who knows.

(The Camera dei Deputati (lower house) will likely remain with
Proportional Representation for a while, but there is talk of switching a
portion of that house, too. Maybe as much as 40% first-past-the-post)

Overall, the electoral reform in Italy is a welcome change.  Italians
are tired of having crappy government.  Porn stars, Pavarotti's and
Hunters & Fishers won't gain seats because PR is dead.  A good two-party
system will bring Italy efficient, accountable government.

It's about time.

They have a few problems. The biggest technical problem is the need to find
two satellites going to the same rough orbit for a luanch.

They also don't show much interest in commercial launches. There is more
money to be made churning out Titan IV's for the government. After all,
it isn't every day you find a sucker, er, customer who thinks paying

Even easier to implement than writing messages on the Moon, once upon
a time a group of space activists I belonged to in Seattle considered
a "Goodyear Blimp in orbit".  The idea was to use a large structure
that could carry an array of lights like the Goodyear Blimp has.
Placed in a low Earth orbit of high inclination, it could eventually
be seen by almost everyone on Earth.  Only our collective disapproval
of cluttering up space with such a thing stopped us from pursuing
it.  It had quite feasible economics, which I will not post here
because I don't want to encourage the idea (if you want to do such
a thing, go figure it out for yourself).

I don't know about everybody else, but to me, they should have been
convicted BECAUSE of the evidence, which in my mind was quite
sufficient.

Are you your own master?  Do you have any habits that you cannot break?
For one, you seem unable to master your lack of desire to understand
even the slightest concept of the Bible.  Seems that ignorance has you
mastered.  How about sexual sins?  Gotta any of those secret desires
in your head that you harbor but can get control of?   Do you dehumanize
women when they walk past you?  Do you degrade them to a sex object in
your head?  Are you the master of that kind of thinking?  Do you insult
people unknowingly, then regret it later.  Yet do it again the next
time opportunity presents itself?  Are you truly the master of yourself?

I have admitted that I am not the master of my thought life at all times.
That I sometimes say things I do want to say, and then repeat my mistake
unwantingly.  I have admitted to myself that I cannot control every aspect
of my being.  There are times I know I shouldn't say something, but
then say it anyway.  There are times I simply forget a lesson.
I, in fact, am not my own master.  I need help.  Jesus promised me
this help.  And I took him up on his offer.  I have willfully let
Jesus be my master because Jesus knows what is better for me than
I myself do.  And why not?  Does not the creator know his creation
better than the creation?  Does Toyota know what's better for the
Corolla than the Corolla?

Then I guess ignorance is bliss for you.  Because Brian, you enjoy
not having a clue about the Bible.

Can you witness motherly love with your senses?  How does caring and
concern for you register with your senses?  If nothing registers
to you other than what you can see, taste, smell, hear and touch,
then you better become a Vulcan and fast.  You better get rid
of your emotions.

And I do have a good reason to believe what I do.

The topic was about my God and your lack of knowledge about what my
God says.   My God says that you will not CEASE EXISTING.  You have
life forever.  You can choose to either live it in hell in eternal
torment where there is no communication whatsoever, or can choose to 
live it in paradise with God.  That is what my God says.  And that
was the issue.  Your made-up theism is what it is--made up.  It's
wishful thinking.

Is this the religion of Kendigianism?  Most people are not Christian.  Most
people, including Christians,  are not fond of feeling that they
are imperfect.  Is "the world an undesireable place" a doctrine
of Kendigianism?  It has nothing to do with my God.  Does
Kendigism have magical mystical prayers as a part of its worship?
Mine doesn't.  Does Kendigianism believe that the world will be holy again?  
Mine doesn't.  Does Kendigianism also dictate that one must obey what the
priest tells them like good little sheep?  Mine doesn't.  Is this
a bunch of lies you tell yourself so that you can justify being 
ignorant of the Bible?

Brian, following Christ has nothing to do with the doctrines of Kendigianism.
You would find any of your doctrines in the Bible.   I don't follow Kendigianism.
I follow Christ.   Also, to try to again show you your ignorance
of Christ and the Bible in regards to "priests",  have you not read about
the sole Melchizedek priest in Hebrews 7 and 8?  Have you not read what the
purpose is of the Old Testament Levitical priesthood and why there should
NOT be priests today?  Yes, guess what?  The Catholics messed up.  I do
not follow Catholicism or any "ism."  I follow Christ.

>Nope.  You make decisions, enjoy your successes, and accept your

Why would you want to live a good life?
To you, you die and that's it.  Don't contradict yourself.  You have
no reason to live a good life.  It doesn't do you any good in the
end.  Your life doesn't do anybody else any good  either because
everyone dies anyway.  So you have no reason to lead a good life. Leading
a good life is meaningless.   Why do you do such a meaningless thing?

Has the resurrection sunk in?  Jesus is alive.  Jesus is NOT dead.
Jesus was sacrified to fufill the Old Testament sacrificial system
in its every detail.  Jesus's death was like a seed.  He needed
to fall to the ground so that many new lives would take root.  Did
you miss the entire John passage as well?

So we have this highly Christian religious order that put fire
on their house, killing most of the people inside.

I'm not that annoyed about the adults, they knew supposedly what
they were doing, and it's their own actions.

What I mostly are angry about is the fact that the people inside,
including mothers, let the children suffer and die during awful
conditions.

If this is considered religious following to the end, I'm proud
that I don't follow such fanatical and non-compassionate religions.

You might want to die for whatever purpose, but please spare
the innocent young ones that has nothing to do with this all.

I have a hard time just now understanding that Christianity
knows about the word compassion. Christians, do you think 
the actions today would produce a good picture of your 
religion?

Capser, before you deceive everone into thinking that the latter-day
saints have undergone undue persecution through the years for just
believing in their religion, perhaps you would like to tell us all what
happened in the Mountain Meadow Massacres and all the killings that were
done under the Blood Atonement Doctrine, at the command of Brigham Young?

HOW NOT TO WRITE A DEED

One case involved the construction of a conveyance to grantees "jointly, as 
tenants in common, with equal rights and interest in said land, and to the 
survivor thereof, in fee simple. . . . To Have and to Hold the same unto the 
said parties hereto, equally, jointly, as tenants in common, with equal rights 
and interest for the period or term of their lives, and to the survivor thereof 
at the death of the other."

The court held that the survivorship provision indicated an intent to create a 
joint tenancy.  Germain v. Delaine, 294 Ala. 443, 318 So.2d 681 (1975).

This isn't inherently bad.

This isn't really light pollution since it will only
be visible shortly before or after dusk (or during the
day).

(Of course, if night only lasts 2 hours for you, you're probably going
to be inconvienenced. But you're inconvienenced anyway in that case).

Finally: this isn't the Bronze Age, and most of us aren't Indo
European; those people speaking Indo-Eurpoean languages often have
much non-indo-european ancestry and cultural background. So:
please try to remember that there are more human activities than
those practiced by the Warrior Caste, the Farming Caste, and the
Priesthood.

And why act distressed that someone's found a way to do research
that doesn't involve socialism?

It certianly doesn't mean we deserve to die.

On the other side of the fence, I owned a Bieffe off-road helmet.
Took what I would consider a minor fall, and had visible damage
to the shell.  Yes, the helmet did its job.  But the damage/impact
ratio was scary.  I own Bell Moto-5 now, have taken impacts on
order of twice the Bieffe impact (we do this frequently in MX),
and don't even have a scratch on it after two seasons.  My
recommendation is to buy _high_ quality gear.  YMMV.

HAP controls just outside Chicago sells these.  I don't remember which

While I agree with you on that formal training is essential for safe riding,
I disagree strongly with your original point. The point of formal training 
must be to prepare riders for the road. Preparedness is in my opinion
to know as much as possible. So, to exclude some aspects of riding a bike 
in a course is wrong IMHO. Now to countersteering in particular.
Countersteering is something that must be trained. A common reaction among 
new bikers (or bicycle riders) in an emergency situation, is to steer the 
motorcycle like a bicycle. As we know this makes the motorcycle go in the
direction opposite to what was intended. Needless to say, this is dangerous.
I have a specific example: A rider in a left turn. The rider thinks he/she
is to close to the right shoulder of the road, and tries to steer the 
motorcycle to the left by pulling the left handle and pushing the right 
handle. The motorcycle straightens up and goes off the road. 
A worse scenario: The same rider, same turn. In the middle of the turn
the rider sees a truck coming towards him/her. The panicking rider tries
to steer the motorcycle away from the truck and crashes right into it.

The main function of a riding course is to teach how to avoid emergency 
situations, AND what to do if in one. Thus, the knowledge (and training) of
countersteering is IMHO a must in any riding course.

Splitfires work mainly by providing a more-or-less unshrouded spark to the
combustion chamber. If an engine's cylinder head design can benefit from this,
then the splitfires will yield a slight performance increase, most noticeably
in lower rpm range torque. Splitfires didn't do diddly-squat for my 1992 GMC
pickup (4.3l V6) but do give a noticeable performance boost in my 1991 Harley
Sportster 1200 and my best friend's 1986 Sportster 883. Folks I know who've
tried them in 1340 Evo motors can't tell any performance boost over plain
plugs (which is interesting since the XLH and big twin EVO combustion chambers
are pretty much the same shape, just different sizes). Two of my friends who
have shovelhead Harleys swear by the splitfires but if I had a shovelhead,
I'd dual-plug it instead since they respond well enough to dual plugs to make
the machine work and extra ignition system worth the expense (plus they look
really cool with a spark plug on each side of each head)

   I'm sorry, I thought we were discussing heresy.  I assumed that heresy
meant a departure from orthodoxy, in which case generally accepted belief is
indeed an important issue.  In this case, the definition of the word "create"
is of great importance, since creation is the issue being discussed.

  I should have said "given the Mormon belief."  If you disagree with the
Mormon belief that creation is more a function of organization of eternally
existent substance than one of ex nihilo creation, then that is the important
point.

such terms.

   It always cracks me up when anti-Mormons presume to tell Mormons what they
believe.  Mormons do, in fact, believe that all people, including Christ and
Lucifer, are children of God in the sense that we were all created (or
organized or whatever) by Him.  We also believe that being "offspring" of
God has a symbolic sense when applied to being spiritually "born again" of
Him.  Thus the same word can be used to convey different meanings.  This is
how language works, Robert, and it's why making someone an offender for a
word is dangerous.

   On the contrary, Robert, it is not a red herring at all to show that those
who rely wholly on the Bible cannot seem to agree on what it says.  You say
that one must simply "look at the Bible" to see what it teaches, but centuries
of people doing just that have sho0wn that no one is really sure what it says.

  Let me clarify this one more time.  You did not refer to the Mormon belief
that Jesus needed to be saved, but rather to McConkie's belief in same.  We
keep trying to point out to you that Bruce McConkie is not the source of
Mormon doctrine, and you keep ignoring it. (see below)

  On the contrary, Robert, if you are quoting McConkie's words as Mormon
canon then the question of whether they are canon or not is of *great*
importance.  The fact is that they are not.  Whether or not they indicate
general Mormon belief would only be ascertainable by interviewing a large
number of Mormons.

The article that follows was taken from the Wednesday, April 14, 1993
issue of USA Today ("Drug Use Up Among U.S. eighth-graders" by Mike
Snider, p. 6D).

    A new national survey says drugs are easier to get, more teens are
    using them and fewer deem drug use as risky. 

    For the last two years, government officials have trumpeted results
    from the National High School Survey as signs that the drug war is
    being won.  But this year, officials are retreating - drug use by
    eighth-graders has risen, according to the survey of 50,000 students
    nationwide.

    Possible reason for the increase:  more experimentation.  Why?  If
    drug use dropped during the '80s, eventually some students will
    have fewer "drug-using contemporaries" who act as examples of
    substance abuse's drawbacks, says social psychologist Lloyd Johnston,
    one of the survey authors.  Each new wave of youths "must be given
    the knowledge, skills and motivation to resist using these drugs,"
    Johnston says.

    This type of resurgence "is possible," says Eileen Shiff, author of
    "Experts Advise Parents" (Delta, $14.95).  But that's not the issue,
    she says.  The prevalence of alcohol and drugs among teens today
    could result in more alcoholic adults decades from now.

    Aggravating the problem:  baby boomer parents - who experimented with
    drugs and alcohol as teens - trying to be friends, not parents, to
    their children.  "I've even seen parents serving kegs of beer" to
    their underage kids and friends, Shiff says.  For a recent graduation,
    Shiff and other parents organized an all-night, "lock-in" party where
    no booze or drugs were allowed.  "We need to fulfill that parental
    role, otherwise the peer group takes over," she says.

    Officials may "talk about the war on drugs, but they really haven't
    done anything that I've seen," says Suzanne Linkous, Scottsdale,
    Ariz., 16, a volunteer who talks with teens about drugs, dating and
    other issues on a peer counseling and suicide hot line.  Linkous, a
    member of USA Today's Teen Panel, says "there's always going to be
    experimentation" with drugs.

    A real war on drugs could be waged "education-wise," she says.  But
    "some don't want to give kids the facts.  They think it will give
    them ideas; it's the same with birth control.  I think you should
    give the kids the information or have it accessible" through classes,
    pamphlets and speakers, she says.

    Education efforts need to start as soon as kids get in school - in
    kindergarten, says Dallas Owens, 17, teen panelist from Miami Shores,
    Fla.  "I remember in kindergarten, I used to see (drugs).  I think
    kids in the 10th and 12th grades have already made up their minds
    (about using drugs)," he says.

    Scare tactics in public service announcements aren't working; only
    one commercial has gotten it right, he says.  The commercial opens
    with two "good-looking girls" in the restroom talking about having
    no prom date.  Then they take a hit off a joint.  "That hits home
    because it's not attractive," he says.  "You can't be doing drugs if
    you want somebody to like you."

He'd have to go a far ways to run things down as bad as Reagan and Bush

       Horrors, appealing to popular principles.  Can we perhaps as the
question of whether the Constitution might have been written to appeal
to the principles, rather than, as you appear to believe, it was written
with something else in mind and "propoganda" put out by its supporters.

       But let's be honest about something, here.  When was the last time
you brought up all the valid points against your own arguments?

       Or are they simply propogranda?  We can't know what Phill *really*
means because he's obviously using arguments designed to convince.

       If they're true or false, regardles of why they were said, why
on earth did you make a point of calling them "propogranda?"  That
would seem to be irrelevent.

       Oh, I have no argument with questioning them.  I don't believe
they no longer apply, but that's because I think most of them were
good arguments.  I'm not entirely happy about the situation, because
they were obviously only applied to a minority of the time, but I don't
think that alone is sufficient to invalidate them.

       Since the U.S. constitution is the basis for the U.S. political
system, most changes in it would require Constitutional change.  In this
particular case, however the fillibuster is a matter of procedure
and tradition.  It only *should* have been made part of the Constitution. :-)

        In principle no?  That they had less power of that they should have

        Phill, we're discusing the power of legislative houses.  While
the Prime Minister *is* member of Parliament, he is more analgous (although
badly) to the U.S. President.

        Now, please explain to me how the U.S. House of Representatives
is "in principle" more powerful than the House of Lords (or the Senate)
but in practice is less.  Are you suggesting that the writers of the
Constitution *really* intended for them to be more powerful, but gosh
darn the thing was ratified before they realized they'd forgotten to put
those extra restrictions on the Senate in?

      Not at all.  As any entry level political science course will tell
you, people who want laws implemented will always choose the level of
government to "attack" which presents them with the best chance of
getting what they want.  With national "interest groups" it is simply
a very rational thing to do to want the Federal government to enact a
law rather than the states.  Less people to persuade, and less 
"contributions" to make.  

      Why do those concerned about abortion primarily concentrate at
the Federal level?  Simply because if they win that battle all the little
state battlefields are won by extension.  The same extends to insurance,
medicine, and most other questions.

      Local government has not "failed" in that it hasn't done what it
should, but that it is dominated by local interests.  Thus non-local
interests who want localities to abide by their rules can't get their
rules past the local government.  Thus, since they've got more clout,
only in the wrong place, they appeal to the next higher level because
it can impose its will on the lower.

      I mean, let's get real here.  Do we *really* need the Congres
of the United States deciding that x traffice light should be on thus-
and such pattern?  Or that *carjacking* needs to be a federal as opposed
to a local crime?

      The more people want the more Congress will take power to "sell"
it to them for their votes.  I don't think the rise of "special interests"
is coincidence with the increased power of Congress.

       Bingo.  The higher up the governmental ladder the less actual
need matters, because political power can be concentrated at higher
levels, while people with less cloud only find themselves reduced to
in effectiveness.

       Then why not simply leave New York's education to New York?  I
remain unconcinved that there is any state in the Union which is not capable
of educating its own children if that's what they want to do.  And if
you leave it to them, you only have to worry about the "pork" in that
state.  And since industries can't concentrate their political power
and wealth, rather they must divide it among the states to try and get
what they want, individual voices have more relative impact.

       The problem with the fillibuster is not that you must "buy off"
states, but that the Congress has acquired too much power to sell pork.

       But why on earth should we want to redirect it?  You said yourself 
that you have to sell pork to get things through Congress.  If Congres
has less authority to sell pork and retains its authority to enact
national legislation within its granted jurisdiction, the pork problem
is significantly reduced.

>The current blocks on power simply absolve congress of any responsibility
>to come to a decision. 

       The current blocks essentially state that inaction is preferable
to action, thus it the system is weighted against action.  Considering
the government the usually the institution with the sole power to
enforce its decisions by force, I consider bias against making those
decisions a good thing.

>Pushing the decisions lower in the pyramid won't

       The difference with the lower pyramid is that a) they have
more legal, legitimate authority in most matters under our Constitution
than the federal government, and b) at those lower levels power is
harder to concentrate.  And c) you get the benefit of not imposing
new deicisons on everybody at once.  You get to see them tried out
without a national decision.  Congressional action usually treats the
entire country as a whole, yet even with similar problems in different
areas, different solutions may be called for.

       And while I often don't agree with the decisions my local
and state reps make, at least I have a better option of going to
the city council and shooting my mouth off.  I'd much rather the
majority of laws be made by accessible people who hang around and end
up having to put up with them rather than somebody far off in
Washington with half a million or more constituents.

       I'm curious what you base your assumption that lower levels
are more corrupt.

       Phill, *you* brought up the Federalist papers.  We were
arguing the fillibuster and whether or not a minority of Senators
should be allowed to hold up a bill.  You claimed the Senate was
suppose to be a far less powerful House, and I contended there was
nothing in the Constitution or other writings which indicated this.
Which was when you brought up that we can't decide what the founders
wanted based on the Federalist papers.  You argued against them,
I never argued from them.  I have primarily referred to the Constitution,
which places only very small restrictions on the Senate than for
the House.

       The U.S. Constitution is a nuts-and-bolts document.  The Delcaration
of Independence was the high-brow reasoning.  (There are a couple of other
examples, though, such as the reasoning for the power to tax, and the
reasoning for the power to grant permits, both in Article I, Section 8.)

       To a certain extend I do believe the veto has become something
it wasn't intended.  However, I also believe it is inevitable considering
the Congress' own abuse of their power to make bills say whatever they
want them to say.  Unlike most people I think we shouldn't be worrying
about the veto, which is fine, but of the problem in Congress which
almost necessitates its abuse.

       *BUSH?*  Phill, that's absurd.  Bush had *37* vetos, one of

anything resembling a record.

       Why not?  What is inherently wrong with biasing the system
against action?  Historically governemnt action in the U.S. when
dealing with issues with a bare minority and a large minority have
not been successful.  When you're in a position of imposing federal
power on diverse people, why should the federal government not have to
got through something more than a bare majority

       Now we're switching from a general question of a fillibuster
to a specific bill.  I don't see how it make a difference.

       Sure it's arguable.  Theyr'e *arguing* it.  However, requiring
60% to bring it to a vote ensures that they'll have to have a *good*
argument.  Something that isn't based solely on party lines.

       No, I am completely happy with a system which requires a minority
for *action*.  Since U.S. history is a history of carving up population
groups and implementing piece-meal on minorities, I feel minorities
should have sufficent clout to prevent action they feel strongly enough
about.  And 41% is hardly a tiny minority.  I don't advocate the minority
being capable of initiating actionm but I see no problem with biasing
the *federal* system against action.

Yes, sadly, this is true. The primary reason, and the essence of the
details that you are seeking, is that the Grahm-Rudman budget controls
were working.  In fact, they were working so well that unless the feds
did something, they were going to have to start cutting pork. So Bush
and the Democrats got together in a Budget Summit and replaced
Grahm-Rudman with the now historic Grand Compromise in which Bush
"consented" to raise taxes in exchange for certain caps on spending
increases.

As it turned out, the taxes killed the Reagan expansion and the caps
on spending increases were dispelled by Clinton in his first act as
President (so that he could create his own new plan with more tax
increases).

The result is that Clinton now HOPES to reduce the deficit to a level 
ABOVE where it was when Reagan left office.

Chew on that awhile.

If we do, I think you'd loose.  Sure, you're hand's already on the
throttle.  And your thumb is already near the horn button.  Pushing the
horn button is one simple move.  Revving the throttle requires either
engaging the clutch, or accelerating.  The first is a more complex
manuver than a simple horn button push, and the second ain't too bright
when there is a potential hazard ahead.  Besides, the unique sound of a
horn is more effective in attracting the attention of BDI cagers than
is the sound of an engine, which is what they expect to hear (you are
on the road!).

As is usually the case, a single anecdote hardly constitutes sound
safety procedure.

The answer is 161.33 feet.

Since this drivel is also crossposted to alt.atheism, how about reading
the alt.atheism FAQ? The Josephus quote is concidered to be a fake even
by Christian historians, and the four gospels contradict each other in

Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs) are seen coming equally from all directions.
However, given the number of bright ones, there are too few faint
ones to be consistent with being equally dense for as far
as we can see--it is as if they are all contained within
a finite sphere (or a sphere with fuzzy edges) with us at the
center.  (These measurements are statistical, and you can
always hide a sufficiently small number of a different
type of GRB with a different origin in the data.  I am assuming
that there is only one population of GRBs).

The data indicates that we are less than 10% of the radius of the center
of the distribution.  The only things the Earth is at the exact center
of are the Solar system (at the scale of the Oort cloud of comets
way beyond Pluto) and the Universe.  Cosmological theories, placing
GRBs throughout the Universe, require supernova-type energies to
be released over a timescale of milliseconds.  Oort cloud models
tend to be silly, even by the standards of astrophysics.

If GRBs were Galactic (i.e. distributed through the Milky Way Galaxy)
you would expect them to be either concentrated in the plane of
the Galaxy (for a 'disk' population), or towards the Galactic center
(for a spherical 'halo' population).  We don't see this, so if they
are Galactic, they must be in a halo at least 250,000 light years in
radius, and we would probably start to see GRBs from the Andromeda
Galaxy (assuming that it has a similar halo.)  For comparison, the
Earth is 25,000 light-years from the center of the Galaxy.

>my own pet theory is that it's  Flying saucers  entering

The aren't concentrated in the known spacelanes, and we don't
see many coming from Zeta Reticuli and Tau Ceti.

There are more than 130 GRB different models in the refereed literature.
Right now, the theorists have a sort of unofficial moratorium
on new models until new observational evidence comes in.

What in the Tree makes you think we queers CAN'T experience that commitment? 
What's stopping us from committing to one partner for the rest of our lives? 
I have every intention of doing so, once I find the right person...and

Hello--

I just bought a new portable CD player for the office, and I notice that
it proudly proclaims "8 TIMES OVERSAMPLING" on the box.  Now while I think
I understand what oversampling is (the rate of discrete "samples"
exceeds the highest frequency component of interest by some factor),
I don't understand this "8 TIMES" business...  It seems to me that when
I bought my first CD player (was it REALLY 10 years ago?!), the specs
said "4 TIMES" ...  Could someone please tell me whether I'm getting
senile?  If I'm not, then what good does it do for the player to take
samples at a higher rate?  If I really wanted better fidelity, wouldn't
I have to have the same higher rate of sampling during the recording
process?  Furthermore, am I wrong in interpreting the sampling rate
(from the player's point of view) as being the same thing as the data
rate for the bit stream coming off the optical medium?  Does this mean
that the data rate (related to the rotational speed of the disk) has 
changed since 1983?

I'm so confused...

For the purpose of a contest, I'd bet some things could be cut.  Like fuel
for re-entry, any kind of heat shielding, etc., etc.  Even still, if the
contest participants had to fund DC-1 development, it probably wouldn't be
worth it to develop DC-1 (just for the contest).  Just give me the cheapest
heaviest lift man rated (or at least under 6 or so Gs) booster...  If I
don't have to pay for DC-1 development, great!, I'll use it.

But back to the contest goals, there was a recent article in AW&ST about a
low cost (it's all relative...) manned return to the moon.  A General
Dynamics scheme involving a Titan IV & Shuttle to lift a Centaur upper
stage, LEV, and crew capsule.  The mission consists of delivering two
unmanned payloads to the lunar surface, followed by a manned mission. 
Total cost:  US was $10-$13 billion.  Joint ESA(?)/NASA project was $6-$9
billion for the US share.

I didn't find a mention of how long the crew could stay, but I'd bet that
its  around 30 days.  And the total payload delivered was about 30 metric
tonnes.  So if you ignore the scientific payload, hitch a ride in the crew
habitation module (no return trip...), and toss in a few more tonnes for
the additional consumables to last another 11 months, then you *might* be
able to get a year visit out of 15 tonnes (and in case its not obvious,
that's a wild ass guess).  A pretty boring visit, since every trip outdoors
eats up a bit of LOX.  And I'm not certain if a home brewed (or
college-brewed) life support system could last a year.  But let's round
this up to 19.4 tonnes (convient, since the GD plan talks about 9.7 ton
payloads delivered to the lunar surface.  This adds up to two Centaurs, two
LEVs, two Shuttle flights... All to put a single man on the moon for a
year.   Hmmm.  Not really practical.  Anyone got a cheaper/better way of
delivering 15-20 tonnes to the lunar surface within the decade?  Anyone
have a more precise guess about how much a year's supply of consumables and
equipment would weigh?

And I was wondering about the GD LEV.  Is it reusable?  Or is it discarded
to burn up on return to LEO?  If its not discarded, could it be refueled? 
Henry: Do you know anything about the GD LEV?  I noted that it uses RL-10
engines.  Aren't they reusable/restartable?  Would a LEV fit in a DC-1? 
I've forgotten (if I ever knew) what the cargo bay dimensions are for the
DC-1.

All in all, I'm not certain that the single goal/prize of staying on the
moon for a year is wise and/or useful.  How about:  A prize for the first
non-government sponsered unmanned moon landing, then another for a manned
moon landing, then yet another for a system to extract consumables from
lunar soil, another for a reusable earth/moon shuttle, and so forth.  Find
some way to build civilian moonbase infrastructure...  Having a single goal
might result in a bunch of contestents giving up after one person appeared
to win.  And for those that didn't give up, I find something a little scary
about a half dozen people huddling in rickety little moon shelters.  I'd
like to see as much a reward for co-operation as for competition.

Lastly, about ten or fifteen years back I seem to recall that there was an
English space magazine that had an on-going discussion about moonbases on
the cheap.  I recalled it discussed things like how much heat the human
body produced, how much lunar material it'd need for protection from solar
flares, etc.  Unfortunately I don't remember the name of this magazine. 
Does this ring a bell to anyone?

No need to be sorry, I blew it on this one.  At the main breaker box

What an exciting thread (finally!)

Mitra is Sanskrit for Friend, as such He started out as an avatar of Lord Visnu
 mentioned first in the Vedas. Later he seems to have risen to chief prominence
 worshipped by the Persians. Associated with the Sun but NOT the Sun, he is
 the lord of contract honor and obedience, therefore naturally worshipped by
 soldiers. He was ordered by the Sun to slay the bull of heaven and He reluct-
 antly agreed because of His obligation...the blood of that bull spilled and
 grew all earth life...then Mitra and the Sun sat down to eat.

Worship of Lord Mitra ended in Persia with the ascension of the Zoroastrians.

Hundreds of years later He was rediscovered and thrown into the Official Roman
 Pantheon (tm) for some semi-tricky reason, I forget why. But all references of
 Him ended abruptly when He was stricken from same, so apparently His worship
 was some sort of vehicle for advancement in the bureaucracy, like membership
 in the Communist Party was in the Soviet Bloc. The sociology of religion in
 ancient times is fascinating!

Oh, His B-day was 25 Dec. Ahem.

I am not sure if the mystery cult really lasted after His was booted from the
 Roman Imperial God Roster or what. It contained mostly soldiers, with 7 levels
 of initiation. They worshipped underground in caverns in pews. The bull horns
 in those temples were for scaring away or impaling evil spirits, I'm not sure
 that they had Mithraic significance or not.

I don't know that the ritual meal was of a cannibalistic nature as is the
 Christian masses. But eating deities goes way back to Old Kingdom Egypt.

Someone mentioned bullfighting. Did Mithraists sacrifice bulls? I forget. More
 likely, for a religious source, might be the shower of bull's blood enjoyed
 by the worshippers of Cybele on the Day of Blood? Cybele worship extended all
 throughout even up to France bigtime.

Let me guess.  You were making a left turn, correct?  The edge of the stud
contacting the road caused it to turn and unthread itself.  If you had 
been making a right turn it would have tightened the stud.

No, they fold on the dotted line.  Look at pictures of carriers with loads of

I was very lucky I found a jacket I liked that actually _fits_.
HG makes the v-pilot jackets, mine is a very similar style made
by Just Leather in San Jose. I bought one of the last two they
ever made.

Finding decent womens motorcycling gear is not easy.  There is a lot
of stuff out there that's fringed everywhere, made of fashion leather,
made to fit men, etc.  I don't know of a shop in your area.  There
are some women rider friendly places in the San Francisco/San Jose
area, but I don't recommend buying clothing mail order.  Too hard
to tell if it'll fit.  Bates custom makes leathers.  You might want
to call them (they're in L.A.) and get a cost estimate for the type
of jacket your wife is interested in.  Large manufacturers like
BMW and H.G. sell women's lines of clothing of decent quality, but
fit is iffy.

A while ago, Noemi and Lisa Sieverts were talking about starting
a business doing just this sort of thing.  Don't know what they
finally decided.

There is a wonderful book by Jean Meeus called

What would all of you out there in net land think of the big 6 (Martin
Mariatta, Boeing, Mcdonell Douglas, General Dynamics, Lockheed, Rockwell)
getting together, and forming a consortium to study exactly what the market
price pints are for building reusable launch vehicles, and spending say
$3million to do that.  Recognizing that most of the military requirements
for launch vehicles are pulled out of a hat somewhere (say, has the shuttle 
ever really used that 1200mi crossrange capability?  You get the idea, figure
out how many, how often, where to, etc...)

Then taking this data, and forming a sematech type company (bad example, I
know... but at least its an example...)  To develop between 3 and 5 craft
designs.  Then to take all of those designs, and figure out EXACTLY what
the technologies are, and demonstrate those technologies, in order to 
eliminate designs that can't be built today.  And lets say that this
portion again funded by the GOV cost about $20 million.

And from here all of these companies went their separate ways, with the
intention of taking all of the market data and the design data to wall
street, and saying "I want to build this vehicle, and here are the numbers
that show %20 ROI, fund me...)


Now many of you think that this is a joke, but I have it on good authority that
just this project is shaping up in the background. It seems that the aerospace
companies have learned that everyone yelling similar but different things
ends up in many programs that do nothing much and get canceled (NASP, NLS,
ALS, DCY?, etc...)  They need to work more in the japaneese, and european
spirit of initial cooperation.  They have also learned that design requirements
that are phony (I.E. some generals idea of what a space vehicle ought to be)
ends up getting chopped up in congress, because it is not a REAL requirement.

Any feedback?

FORTUNE-GUZZLER BARRED FROM BARS

Barnstaple, England/Reuter

	A motorcyclist said to have drunk away a $290,000 insurance payment in
less than 10 years was banned Wednesday from every pub in England and Wales.

	David Roberts, 29, had been awarded the cash in compensation for
losing a leg in a motorcycle accident. He spent virtually all of it on cider, a
court in Barnstaple in southwest England was told.

	Judge Malcolm Coterill banned Roberts from all bars in England and
Wales for 12 months and put on two years' probation after he started a brawl in
a pub.

I don't know the rating of the battery, but it is a factory

Since our doctors are private and the "system" is just an insurance
plan, litigation would not involve the insurance fund.  Our lawyers
do not work on contingency, so that if you were to sue for malpractice
then you'd better be sure of winning to cover your fees ... likewise,
if you were a doctor and subject of a suit, it's time to sweat.

A few weeks ago, the president of the Canadian MA wrote a letter to
the NYT to decry a lobbyist's advert repeating the same old trash.
This is significant because the AMA and the CMA are interlinked
organizations and he would not have done it without the approval 
of his AMA cronies.

It serves the same purpose as the Bethesda Naval Hospital ... since
not all hospitals can provide everything, maybe they have some stuff
that others don't?  (Ottawa's population is only a quarter million,

People of influence will get their way in any system, American or
European.  It's the "Golden Rule" - he who has the gold makes the
rules. (-;

As for annual budgets, those are actually annual grants for facilities
(e.g., mops, pans, etc.) given to hospitals of which most are private
nonprofit foundations (btw, I have no problem with having aggressive
for-profit hospitals like the French, who use our approach ... but in
the Paris region they have almost as many people as Canada does so
their market is much more diverse).  The rest has to be made up for
by billings from patients who use their services.

The GDP figures are combined public and private expenditures for total
outlay, and  are compiled use the same methods by the OECD that yield 
the 13-14% figure for the U.S.

>So what happens if the health care systems financially collapse.

How?  They are collecting premiums ... and I'm an advocate of having
copayments like the French do in their system in order to make it look
more like the real insurance that it is.  The private doctors and 
hospitals will still be there after the insurance (hypothically)
disappears, as they were there before it appeared.

For one thing, I think that Bob Rae is an idiot ...

Most of OHIP comes from separate premiums on your paycheck if you are
a player ...  he wants to spend our money on other things than the
health insurance.  Our high taxes are high for other spending but
health insurance, which is separate and optional, and it is being 
spent in a nonpartisan manner by every party. )-;

OHIP is just a health insurance plan; it does not provide any kind
of health care, that is up to you and your private doctors.

Some of the companies providing extra insurance are subsidiaries of
American companies, and their parents provide full insurance down
here.  Regardless, all firms up north can easily turn on cable TV
to see how well the American firms are doing by being involved in
basic coverage.  The private firms are making too much money after
having gotten rid of basic coverage.  They run around patting them-
selves on the back for their own cooperation in providing extras 
for those people who "deserve it".

I agree ... they were in a win-win situation.  But right now, it seems
that they have won bigger, when you look at how full their coffers
are.  Friends from my sisters' MBA class were still being flown out
for job interviews individually with insurance firms in London, ON,
(Canada's insurance capitol a la Hartford) along with generous expense
privileges this year despite the ongoing post-recession blues.

 ========================================================================
A couple of points on this thread.

1. We have been using our processes since way before Challenger.  Challenger
   in and of it self did not uncover flaws.

2. What Mr. Spencer says is by and large true.  We have a process that is
   not dependent on "sophisticated tools"  (CASE tools?).  However, tools
   cannot fix a bad process.  Also, tool support for HAL/S (the Shuttle
   Language) is somewhat limited.

3. The Onboard Flight Software project was rated "Level 5" by a NASA team.
   This group generates 20-40 KSLOCs of verified code per year for NASA.

4. Feel free to call me if you or your organization is interested in more info
   on our software development process.

The point is that the original poster was talking about connecting
ground and neutral in the *outlet* box (big NO NO), and you are talking
about them being connected in the breaker box (as things should be).

If this is not obvious, the point is that there should be current
flow in the white, i.e. neutral/return wires when things in the
house are operating.  There should not be any flow in the ground wires
unless there is a fault condition.  Notice also that in the breaker box
there is a wire leading from the above-mentioned junction to earth ground,
usually a pipe or spike driven into the ground.

It's normal for the BMW K bikes to use a little oil in the first few thousand 
miles.  I don't know why.  I've had three new K bikes, and all three used a
bit of oil when new - max maybe .4 quart in first 1000 miles; this soon quits
and by the time I had 10,000 miles on them the oil consumption was about zero.
I've been told that the harder you run the bike (within reason) the sooner
it stops using any oil.

That's completely inaccurate.  The ohm was an original standard made equal
to a the resistance of a standardized electric stove heating element.  That's
where the song "Ohm on the Range" came from, of course.

The "face" is an accident of light and shadow.  There are many "faces" in
landforms on Earth; none is artificial (well, excluding Mount Rushmore and
the like...).  There is also a smiley face on Mars, and a Kermit The Frog.

The question of life in a more mundane sense -- bacteria or the like -- is
not quite closed, although the odds are against it, and the most that the
more orthodox exobiologists are hoping for now is fossils.

There are currently no particular plans to do any further searches for life.

>Are we going back to Mars to look at this face agian?

Mars Observer, currently approaching Mars, will probably try to get a better
image or two of the "face" at some point.  It's not high priority; nobody
takes it very seriously.  The shadowed half of the face does not look very
face-like, so all it will take is one shot at a different sun angle to ruin
the illusion.

At one time there was speculation that the first spacewalk

Has any evidence to support or contradict this claim emerged ?

Was this claim perhaps another fevered Cold War hallucination ?

Bzzzt.  The 750SS is 40 pounds lighter than the 900SS.  I personally,
and recently, witnessed my 750SS do a stoppie with a larger-than-
average rider aboard.  He said it took two fingers on that measely
single front disk to accomplish the task.  How much more brake do
you need?

I haven't gone over 4000 rpm yet (still in break in) and haven't
had a problem with the 750SS being too slow.  The limited steering
lock can be a problem if you aren't prepared for it.  The mirrors
are very good, IMHO.  Someone forgot to tell their designer about
the "whazza behind you, she no matta" philosophy.

First, the only drug that could possibly be put in drug stations are marijuana 
or its derivitives.  Every other drug that I can think of can kill you if you 
take to much.  (By the very nature of these drugs, your decision making skills 
aren't up to par.  That is how it differs from asprin, flinstone vitamins, etc.
We don't even allow penicilin to be sold over the counter.)

Second, we already have a big enough drunk driving and alchoholic problem in 
this country.  If marijuana were legal, undoubtedly more people would use it, 
and that IS a problem.  People use it, get stupid, and hurt other people.

The Orion concept as actually proposed (as opposed to the way it has been
somewhat misrepresented in some fiction) included wrapping a thick layer
of reaction mass -- probably plastic of some sort -- around each bomb.
The bomb vaporizes the reaction mass, and it's that which transfers
momentum to the pusher plate.

I had a GE Emerson 13" color TV for about 3 years and one fine day,
while we were watching something (I doubt if the program was the cause),
we heard a mild explosion.   Our screen went blank but there was sound,
so we thought, 'oh we have special effects on the program'.  But soon
the sound stopped and smoke started to appear at the back of the TV.
The brilliant EEs we are, we unplugged the TV and called customer service
only to be thrown around by please hold, I will transfer u to blah blah..
  Finally we abandoned the idea of trying to fix the TV and got a new one
(we wanted a bigger one too!).
 After all the story, what I wanted to know is: Is my problem an isolated
incident or a common one? (I recall reading about Russian TVs exploding, but
not here, in the US). Why would the picture tube explode or even smoke?
 I still have the left over TV set, I might dig into it this summer. Any
idea where I can get parts for these things? (probably will cost more than TV).

Is it right??? That is new stuff for me. So it means that  you just can 
not put a sattellite around around the Moon for too long because its 
orbit will be unstable??? If so, what is the reason??? Is that because 
the combined gravitacional atraction of the Sun,Moon and Earth 
that does not provide a stable  orbit around the Moon???

I am sure  Mary or Henry can describe this more aptly then me.
But here is how i understand it.

At Speed,  Near supersonic.  The wind behaves like a fluid pipe.
It becomes incompressible.  So wind has to bend away from the
wing edges.   AS the wing thickens,  the more the pipes bend.

If they have no place to go,  they begin to stall,  and force
compression, stealing power from the vehicle (High Drag).

If you squeeze the fuselage,  so that these pipes  have aplace to bend
into,  then drag is reduced.   

Essentially,  teh cross sectional area of the aircraft shoulf
remain constant for all areas of the fuselage.  That is where the wings are
subtract, teh cross sectional area of the wings from the fuselage.

Actually not.  Brett himself has actually posted the data previously.
What declined from 84 to 89, as I remember it, was _percent
increase_in_deficit_growth, i.e. the rate of growth of the deficit 
(2nd derivative of total deficit with respect of to time) decreased.
Brett apparently has numbed himself into thinking that the deficit
declined.  If you keep spending more than you earn, the deficit keeps
growing.  If you keep _borrowing_ at a lesser rate than you borrowed
previously, the deficit increases.  You only decrease deficits when your
income exceeds spending and you use the difference to pay off debts.

Figgie's book paints the real data, pictorially, in gory detail.  Each
president, essentially ran up twice as much total debt, in half the time.
Reagan/congress was simply awful.  Bush/congress was unbelievable.

As a really rigorous aside to this thread.....

During pledge night the other night on the public channel, there was an
"economist" who gave an hour or so presentation.  His data was predictive
and based largely on population data. I don't know his name, but his
arguments were brilliant.  He confirmed, with data, what many of us know
with common sense -- the boom of the 80's has nothing to do with government
policy, particularly "supply side" policy, since taxes do not "cause" 
economic activities.  People cause economic activity.  More can be 
explained by watching population waves roll through the years and 
create cycles.  He has made models and predictions for years well into
the middle of next century.  It will be neat to see how accurate he
is.

ONLINE AND OTHER SOURCES OF IMAGES, DATA, ETC.


INTRODUCTION

    A wide variety of images, data, catalogs, information releases, and
    other material dealing with space and astronomy may be found on the net.
    A few sites offer direct dialup access or remote login access, while the
    remainder support some form of file transfer. Many sites are listed as
    providing 'anonymous FTP'. This refers to the File Transfer Protocol on
    the Internet. Sites not connected to the Internet cannot use FTP
    directly, but there are a few automated FTP servers which operates via
    email. Send mail containing only the word HELP to ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com
    or bitftp@pucc.princeton.edu, and the servers will send you instructions
    on how to make requests.

    The sources with the broadest selection of material are the NASA Ames
    SPACE archive and the National Space Science Data Center.

    Don't even ask for images to be posted to the net. The data volume is
    huge and nobody wants to spend the time on it.


VIEWING IMAGES

    The possible combinations of image formats and machines is forebodingly
    large, and I won't attempt to cover common formats (GIF, etc.) here. To
    read PDS and VICAR (and many other) formats on Unix systems running X,
    use XV 2.11, available by anonymous FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu
    (18.24.0.12) in contrib/xv-2.11.tar.Z and the other standard X11 FTP
    sites.

    The FAQ for the Usenet group alt.binaries.pictures discusses image
    formats and how to get image viewing software. A copy of this document
    is available by anonymous FTP from the Usenet FAQ archives at
    pit-manager.mit.edu (18.72.1.58), in directory
    pub/usenet/alt.binaries.pictures.


ONLINE ARCHIVES

    NASA AMES

    Extensive archives are maintained at NASA Ames and are available via
    anonymous FTP or an email server. These archives include many images and
    a wide variety of documents including this FAQ list, NASA press
    releases, shuttle launch advisories, and mission status reports. Please
    note that these are NOT maintained on an official basis.

    FTP users should connect to ames.arc.nasa.gov (128.102.18.3) and look in
    pub/SPACE. pub/SPACE/Index contains a listing of files available in the
    archive (the index is about 200K by itself).

    To access the archives by email, send a letter to
    archive-server@ames.arc.nasa.gov (or ames!archive-server). In the
    subject of your letter (or in the body), use commands like:

	send SPACE Index
	send SPACE SHUTTLE/ss01.23.91.

    The capitalization of the subdirectory names is important. All are in
    caps. Only text files are handled by the email server at present; use
    one of the FTP email servers described in the introduction to this
    section for images or programs.

    The Magellan Venus and Voyager Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus CD-ROM image
    disks have been put online in the CDROM and CDROM2 directories. The
    disks will be rotated on a weekly basis. Thousands of images are
    available in these collections.

    The GIF directory contains images in GIF format. The VICAR directory
    contains Magellan images in VICAR format (these are also available in
    the GIF directory). A PC program capable of displaying these files is
    found in the IMDISP directory (see the item "VIEWING IMAGES" below).

    The NASA media guide describes the various NASA centers and how to
    contact their public affairs officers; this may be useful when pursuing
    specific information. It's in MISC/media.guide.

    Any problems with the archive server should be reported to Peter Yee
    (yee@ames.arc.nasa.gov).


    NASA ASTROPHYSICS DATA SYSTEM

    The ADS is a distributed data retrieval system which is easy to use and
    provides uniform access to ground-based and space-based astronomy data
    from NASA data centers across the country. It currently has over 140
    data catalogs of radio, infrared, optical, UV, and X-ray data which can
    be queried by position or any other parameter in the catalog. The ADS
    also provides tools to manipulate and plot tabular results. In addition,
    ADS has a Beta version of an Abstracts Service which allows users to
    query over 125,000 abstracts of astronomy papers since 1975 by authors,
    keywords, title words, or abstract text words.

    ADS use requires direct Internet access. For more info and to sign up to
    become a user, email ads@cuads.coloradu.edu. The User's Guide and
    "QuickStart" Guide are available by anonymous FTP to sao-ftp.harvard.edu
    in directory pub/ads/ADS_User_Guide (PostScript files).

    NASA SPACELINK

    SpaceLink is an online service located at Marshall Space Flight Center
    in Huntsville, Alabama. The system is specifically designed for
    teachers. The data base is arranged to provide easy access to current
    and historical information on NASA aeronautics, space research, and
    technology transfer information. Also included are suggested classroom
    activities that incorporate information on NASA projects to teach a
    number of scientific principles. Unlike bulletin board systems, NASA
    Spacelink does not provide for interaction between callers. However it
    does allow teachers and other callers to leave questions and comments
    for NASA which may be answered by regular mail. Messages are answered
    electronically, even to acknowledge requests which will be fulfilled by
    mail. Messages are generally handled the next working day except during
    missions when turnaround times increase. The mail system is closed-loop
    between the user and NASA.

    SpaceLink also offers downloadable shareware and public domain programs
    useful for science educators as well as space graphics and GIF images
    from NASA's planetary probes and the Hubble Telescope.

    You can dial in at (205)-895-0028 (300/1200/2400/9600(V.32) baud, 8
    bits, no parity, 1 stop bit), or telnet to spacelink.msfc.nasa.gov
    (128.158.13.250, also known as xsl.msfc.nasa.gov) if you're on the
    Internet. Anonymous FTP capability (password guest) is now available.

    Most of this information is also available from the Ames server in
    directory SPACELINK.


    NATIONAL SPACE SCIENCE DATA CENTER (NSSDC)

    The National Space Science Data Center is the official clearinghouse for
    NASA data. The data catalog (*not* the data itself) is available online.
    Internet users can telnet to nssdca.gsfc.nasa.gov (128.183.36.23) and
    log in as 'NODIS' (no password). You can also get the catalog by sending
    email to 'request@nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov'.

    You can also dial in at (301)-286-9000 (300, 1200, or 2400 baud, 8 bits,
    no parity, one stop). At the "Enter Number:" prompt, enter MD and
    carriage return. When the system responds "Call Complete," enter a few
    more carriage returns to get the "Username:" and log in as 'NODIS' (no
    password).

    The system is menu-driven; topics available as of 3/93 are:

	1   -	Master Directory - NASA & Global Change
	2   -	Personnel Information Management System
	3   -	Nimbus-7 GRID TOMS Data
	4   -	Interplanetary Medium Data (OMNI)
	5   -	Request data and/or information from NSSDC
	6   -	Geophysical Models
	7   -	CANOPUS Newsletter
	8   -	International Ultraviolet Explorer Data Request
	9   -	CZCS Browse and Order Utility
	10  -	Astronomical Data Center (ADC)
	11  -	STEP Bulletin Board Service
	12  -	Standards and Technology Information System
	13  -	Planetary Science & Magellan Project Information
	14  -	Other Online Data Services at NSSDC
	15  -	CD-ROMS Available at NSSDC

    For users with Internet access, datasets are made available via
    anonymous FTP once you select the desired datasets from the online
    catalog. For other users, data may be ordered on CD-ROM and in other
    formats. Among the many types of data available are Voyager, Magellan,
    and other planetary images, Earth observation data, and star catalogs.
    Viewers for Macintosh and IBM systems are also available. As an example
    of the cost, an 8 CD set of Voyager images is $75. Data may ordered
    online, by email, or by physical mail. The postal address is:

    SPACE TELESCOPE SCIENCE INSTITUTE ELECTRONIC INFORMATION SERVICE

    stsci.edu (130.167.1.2) has a large amount of information about the
    Hubble Space Telescope available by anonymous FTP, such as status
    reports and newsletters, in addition to material oriented towards HST
    observers and proposers. Get the top level README file to begin with.
    Contact Pete Reppert (reppert@stsci.edu) or Chris O'Dea
    (odea@stsci.edu).


    STARCAT

    The Space Telescope European Coordination Facility, at ESO/Garching
    provides on-line access to a huge astronomical database, featuring

	- Observation log files of several satellites/telescopes
	    (IUE,IRAS,HST,NTT...).
	- Spectra and images (IUE, HST).
	- Most of the astronomical catalogues (SAO, HR, NGC, PPM, IRAS,
	    Veron, GSC and many others, more than 50) in a very convenient
	    way (give center+radius+kind of objects, and you get the
	    corresponding files!).

    Log on as ``starcat'' (no password) on node stesis.hq.eso.org
    (134.171.8.100) or on STESIS (DECnet). The files created can be
    retreived by FTP. Contact: Benoit Pirenne, bpirenne@eso.org (phone +49
    89 320 06 433) at ST-ECF


    ASTRONOMICAL DATABASES

    The full SAO stellar database is *NOT* available online, probably due to
    the 40 MB size. It may be ordered on magnetic tape from the NSSDC. A
    subset containing position and magnitude only is available by FTP (see
    "Astronomy Programs" below).

    nic.funet.fi (128.214.6.100) has a large collection of astronomical
    programs for many types of computers, databases of stars and deep sky
    objects, and general astronomy information in directory /pub/astro. This
    site is mainly for European users, but overseas connections are
    possible.

    The Ames archives contain a database of 8,436 galaxies including name,
    RA, declination, magnitude, and radial velocity in MISC/galaxy.dat.
    Supplied by Wayne Hayes (wayne@csri.utoronto.ca).

    iris1.ucis.dal.ca (129.173.18.107) has a number of GIFs from Voyager,
    Hubble, and other sources available by anonymous FTP in pub/gif (most of
    this data is also in SPACE/GIF on the Ames server). Please restrict
    access to 5pm - 8am Atlantic time.

    pomona.claremont.edu has the Yale Bright Star catalog for anonymous FTP
    in directory [.YALE_BSC]. Contact James Dishaw
    (jdishaw@hmcvax.claremont.edu).

LANDSAT AND NASA PHOTOS

    You can get black-and-white 1:1M prints, negatives, or positives for
    $10, $18, $12 respectively for any Landsat data more than 2 years old
    from EDC, (Eros (Earth Resources Orbiting Satellite) Data Center). Call
    them at (605)-594-6511. You get 80 meter resolution from the MSS
    scanner, 135x180 kilometers on a picture 135x180 mm in size. I think you
    have to select one band from (green, red, near IR, second near IR), but
    I'm not sure. Digitial data is also available at higher prices.

    Transparencies of all NASA photos available to the public can be

PLANETARY MAPS

    The USGS address for maps of the planets is:

    U.S. Geological Survey,
    Distribution Branch,
    Box 25286, Federal Center, Bldg. 41
    Denver, CO 80225

    Maps cost $2.40 to $3.10 per sheet (a few come in sets of 2 or 3 sheets).

    The best global maps of Mars based on Viking images are 1:15,000,000
    scale in 3 sheets. These maps are:

    I-1535 (2 sheets only) - relief, albedo, names
    I-1535
    I-1618 (3 sheets) - relief, names
    I-2030 (3 sheets) - relief, topographic contours
    I-1802-A,B,C (3 sheets) - geology

    There are many other maps as well: 30 sheets at 1:5,000,000 scale in
    relief, albedo, geology, photomosaic forms (not all 30 sheets available
    in all formats); 140 sheets at 1:2,000,000 scale as photomosaics of the
    whole planet, about 100 sheets of interesting sites at 1:500,000 scale
    in photomosaic format, and lots of special sheets.

    Then there are maps of Mercury, Venus, the Moon, the four Galilean
    Satellites, six moons of Saturn and five of Uranus. [Phil Stooke
    (stooke@vaxr.sscl.uwo.ca), the author of this item, has offered to

COMETARY ORBIT DATA

    The Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams and the Minor Planet
    Center announce the sixth edition of the Catalogue of Cometary Orbits in
    IAU Circular 4935. The catalogue contains 1292 entries which represent
    all known comets through November 1989 and is 96 pages long.
    Non-subscribers to the Circulars may purchase the catalogue for $15.00
    while the cost to subscribers is $7.50. The basic catalogue in ASCII
    along with a program to extract specific orbits and calculate
    ephemerides is available on MS-DOS 5.25-inch 2S2D diskette at a cost of
    $75.00 (the program requires an 8087 math coprocessor). The catalogue
    alone is also available by e-mail for $37.50 or on magnetic tape for
    $300.00.

    Except for the printed version of the catalogue, the various magnetic
    media or e-mail forms of the catalogue do not specifically meantion
    non-subscribers. It is possible that these forms of the catalogue may
    not be available to non-subscribers or that their prices may be more
    expensive than those given. Mail requests for specific information and
    orders to:

	Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams
	Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory

Sorry, the San Jose based Rosicrucian order is called A.M.O.R.C, 
I don't remember for the time being what the A.M. stand for
but O.R.C is Ordo Rosae Crucis, in other words latin for
Order of the Rose Cross. Sigh, seems l'm loosing more and more
of my long term memory.

Otherwise their headquarters in San Jose has a pretty decent
metaphysical bookstore, if any of you are interested in such books.
And my son loves to run around in their Egyptian museum.

Oh, lord.  This is where I came in.

Obcountersteer:  For some reason, I've discovered that pulling on the
wrong side of the handlebars (rather than pushing on the other wrong
side, if you get my meaning) provides a feeling of greater control.  For
example, rather than pushing on the right side to lean right to turn 
right (Hi, Lonny!), pulling on the left side at least until I get leaned
over to the right feels more secure and less counter-intuitive.  Maybe
I need psychological help.

Obcountersteer v2.0:Anyone else find it ironic that in the weekend-and-a-
night MSF class, they don't mention countersteering until after the
first day of riding?

There's plenty of legroom on the Kawasaki KLR650.  A bit
short in the braking department for spirited street riding,
but enough for dirt and for less-agressive street stuff.

Once more around the racetrack. See the original statement that it is
nonsense to believe that you cannot legislate morality. I simply stated
that they can pass all the laws they want but not a single one of them
will make you or I more moral people. They may make us act in a moral
manner, but our actions are only a reflection of the unwillingness to
risk punishment. They say nothing about whether we have become more
moral or not. Perhaps the distinction is too fine.

Well, I'm working on it, but getting a little impatient. So far, 
I've made it through Egyptian, Chinese, and Greek cultures, and
up through the Rennaisance. But so far, these insights just don't 
seem to be gelling. Perhaps it's in an appendix somewhere.

In its own right, though, the history is kind of fun. Lots of 
good yarns in there, with varied and interesting characters. And,
more to come.

	Professionals who train guard dogs, when polled, gave themselves a
1 in 4 chance of survival tackling a trained dog unarmed.  A trained guard
dog is not to be trifled with.  An untrained mutt may be another story.

ObMoto:  A local dog used to chase me all the time.  Really annoying.  I 
finally started stopping every time he'd chase me.  He didn't know what to do
then and would usually just slink off the road.  After a couple weeks of this
he stopped chasing me altogether.  He would still chase cars or other bikes,
though.  I think he recognized me when I went by ;-).

Try a Maxim "MAX232CPE" 8 pin dil, converts 5V to 12V for 232commms.

William: If the reason that this country still stands after 200+ years
is that it uses military conscription to force young men to fight for
causes that they don't believe in strongly enough to volunteer for
military service in support of, then perhaps the fact that the country
is still standing is not good news...

Digi-Key also sells Quad Line Receivers, parts DS1489AN (68cents) and DS1489N
(48cents).  A Quad Line Driver, part DS1488 (48cents), is also sold.  I guess
if you don't won't to supply +12V, the chips with the pump-up circuitry might
be worth the extra cost.  But 1488's and 1489's are available at your friendly
neighborhood RS, parts MC1488 (276-2520) for $1.29 and MC1489 (276-2521) for
$1.29.

I know that when working in Alberta, Ontario and Quebec, I was aware
that I was paying for health insurance - e.g., in Toronto, OHIP fees
were listed seperately on my pay stub.

While I'm not the only Canadian who favours lower taxes and cutbacks
in spending, health insurance isn't on the table.  See our polls ...
A better one might be the July 1st polls conducted for Macleans (our
major English newsmagazine) by Decima Research ... Decima president
Allen Gregg is considered one of the world's top poll researchers,
and Mulroney's Conservatives have relied on him to keep in power in
the face of impossible election situations.  I haven't had a chance
to see this year's version due to our library, but previous ones
before the Americans started their assault and disinformation had
shown satisfaction at 97% and switching to an American all-private
system had support within statistical noise.  The Decima polls are
considered definitive.  Even the new Reform Party, a breakoff of
traditionalists from the Conservatives with a mildly "libertarian"
faction, hold our public health insurance as an untouchable but that
just a few people have to be reminded that it's not free (the average
Canadian/European is more fiscally naive than their American
counterparts on issues like these).

Personally, I feel that the universal health insurance approach used
in Canada, France and Germany -- paying to private health providers in
a nominally free market not unlike America's, minus HMO's -- depends a
lot on values in those societies different from the U.S.  The basic
health needs for life are not viewed as market, but the insurance does
allow the market to address that -- basic health care is not viewed on
the level of ownership of a VCR as Americans would see it.  Plenty of
room is left for expenditure of private funds as extra insurance or as

You are correct; the fastest "complete" image that could be presented on
TV would be one field, which is 1/60 of a second (approximately).  Of course,
the phrase "TV screen" is often thrown around in reference to any CRT
display, so perhaps this researcher wasn't using normal TV rates.  Might
even be a vector ("strokewriter") display, in which case the lower limit
on image time is anyone's guess (and is probably phosphor-persistence limited).

You didn't mention whether or not cost is an issue.  Where
exactly are you running 100MHz??  THe digital side?  TTL?
ECL?  We run 200MHz and 100MHz all over our IC test equipment 
all day long in the ECL domain, and we use DIP's along
with PLCC's, 25mil and 20mil pitch 256pin QFP's to name
a few.  I don't see a problem in packaging as long
as you adhere to sound engineering practices.  

A good source of information is Motorola's MECL System Design
Handbook. The latest ed. is dated 2/88.  That is considered
to be one of the *bibles* in high-speed design.

The very fact that you need to build a test fixture means
you're most likely going to need a socket.  It in itself
has far more inductance per pin than the package you are
testing, not to mention any impedance discontinuities.  I
don't see the big concern over the packaging because it
probably isn't going to make that much difference

If you're trying to get TTL to run at 100MHz, have fun...
TTL was never designed to run in a 100MHz environment.
:-(

P.S. My opinions have nothing to do with my company...the
standard disclaimer applies.


 
        On an A/D board I've got, I'm using the A/D lines.  It measures 
the voltages properly, ie: with a 7v power supply it reg's 7v and with 
5v, it reg's 5v.  Problem is when I've got the input voltage, and I wish 
to lower it via a resistor.  The sensitivity of the board is so great 
that I can triger it with holding the 5/7v wire in one hand, and touch 
the probe and it will register the full input voltage.  A 1m resistor 
only lowers voltage by .1v so this is not too feesable. 
 
                What could the problems be and what else could I use
to lower the input voltage?  (btw I've got it grounded correctly)

As an Amateur Radio operator (VHF 2metres) I like to keep up with what is 
going up (and for that matter what is coming down too).
 
In about 30 days I have learned ALOT about satellites current, future and 
past all the way back to Vanguard series and up to Astro D observatory 
(space).  I borrowed a book from the library called Weater Satellites (I 
think, it has a photo of the earth with a TIROS type satellite on it.)
 
I would like to build a model or have a large color poster of one of the 
TIROS satellites I think there are places in the USA that sell them.
ITOS is my favorite looking satellite, followed by AmSat-OSCAR 13 
(AO-13).

We used to buy Beckman 110 and HD110 ("ruggedized") versions for use
by electricians in the steel mill where I work.   After a while we
got round to filling all the current-input jacks with silicone -
electricians have a regrettable habit of not checking where the last
guy left the leads before using a 3 1/2 digit 0.5 % autoranging $400
meter to check if a fuse is good or not. Its very hard on meters
(and electricians) when you put the milliamp shunt across a 600 volt
bus. 
  But that's not why we stopped buying Beckmans - after a while a 
lot of them got "funny" in the LCD display.  A black stain would
spread from one edge, or else they'd come adrift from those
Zebra connectors and fail to operate.    Now we buy Flukes, the
low-end 20 series mostly ( and we still fill the amp jack with 
silicone). 
  What the world needs is a meter that won't let you change ranges or
turn it on/off with a lead stuck in the amps jack - a little bit of
clever plastic detailing would take care of this and make the world
safer for electricans, anyway.
   Not that I've ever put a meter on the wrong range into a live 
circuit, no, not me...not more than a dozen times, anyway....

The Japanese are still on the learning curve as far as nuclear power goes.
This means that unlike the Germans (who do great things all by themselves)
the Japanese tie up with foreign companies. The major one is Mitsubishi
(who else) who have a sharing agreement with GE I think. No chance of a
new design.

Sodium has *lots* of chemical problems. Like it eats stainless steel. Very
slowly but it gets there in the end. Not what I call a desired property.
As for design difficulties, what does sodium do there? It is a bitch and
it is only its chemical properties (flwed though they are) that means it
gets used. Two loops? That's not a design problem? Isolation from air and
water? That doesn't cause design problems? In comparison BWR's a dream rides!

Don't get none of that in a Liquid Sodium Breeder! More steel, more complexity.

No.  The idea was suggested around here during discussions of possible
near-term commercial space activities.  One of the folks involved in those
discussions, a
spacecraft engineer named Preston Carter, passed the suggestion on to 
some entreprenurial types, and Mike Lawson is apparently going ahead with
it.  Preston is now at LLNL, and is working with Space Marketing on 
the sensors that might be carried.

Actually, that sounds unlikely.  I don't know what the launch vehicle
would be, but I would expect it to go on a commercial launcher --
certainly not on the Shuttle -- and the fraction of the cost paid to NASA
for, e.g.,  launch support would probably 
cover NASA's incremental costs pretty well.

No, as noted, LLNL is involved in lightweight sensor design, per 
Clementine and related programs.  I'm sure folks around here would like to 
see a demonstration of a modern inflatable structure, but after all, 
the U.S. did the Echo satellites long ago, and an advertising structure
would not be much closer to an inflatable space station than Echo was
(or a parade balloon, for that matter).

While I happen to personally dislike the idea, mostly because I've got
a background in astronomy, it's hardly vandalism -- it would be a short-lived
intrusion on the night sky, doing no permanent damage and actually hurting
only a small subset of astronomers.  On the other hand, it would certainly
draw attention to space.

Commercial projects, however, generally don't get "funding" -- they

I use an H11F1   FET optoisolater to switch microphone level signals.
There is no click, since I put a .1uF cap across the LED.  Distortion
measurement are very low with mic level, and they went up to 0.03% at a
+ 14 dB line level.  All I did was put the FET in series with one leg
of the balanced line.  No hums, pops, just audio jumping out of silence.
The FET runs about 100 million ohms with the LED dark and drops to 150-200
ohms with it on.

Hey, it works, and works well.

Tony-

While I honestly believe you believe you are doing a "good thing" by posting
that piece of propaganda, I believe the more people believe that the more they
will feel justified in their blatant persecution of gay oriented people.  I
have seen the film called "The Gay Agenda" and along with my church we found
it to be horrifying.  Not because of what was actually shown (cleaver use of
editting can create any image one wants to portray), rather becaseu we are familia
familiar with how widely it was actively distributed and how many naive people
are actually believing the garbage found within it.  The truth is that neither
you nor I can fully speak for anyone who calls themself gay, but knowing as
many as I do and knowing their testimonies and witnessing thier faith and life
I have to say that the report you posted is a very biased report, something
obviously claimed against gays as well.  The truth is that unless YOU are
innately gay you cannot know what harm you are causing.  I speak as an
abolitionist who supports affirming gay rights in our society.  I do not
support wild sex or any other misrepresentations perpetrated by Christian
Fundamentalist extremists, but I know people who are not the sexual deviants
your report paints them to be.  It is no mistake that the APA removed
homosexuality from it's list of mental illnesses, it is also no mistake that
there are many Christians and homophobes who long to bring it back to the list.
I do not feel threatened by gays, I don't understand why others are.

The following is an article concerning two of the more popular ex-gay min-
istries:  Exodus International & Homosexuals Anonymous.

THE FOUNDER OF AN "EX-GAY" SUPPORT GROUP CHOOSES HOMO OVER HETERO

by Robert Pela (from Gay oriented magazine ADVOCATE)

In December 1985, David Caligiuri received one of The Advocate's homophobia rewaa
awards: the A Prayer A Day Keeps the Lust Away citation.  As director of FREE
INDEED, a national ex-gay ministry, Caligiuri was singled out for offering
discontented gays and lesbians "a way out of the homosexual death-style"
through prayer.  "I'd like to give the award back," Caligiuri now laughs, "I'm
no longer deserve it."
  Caligiuri's eight year involvement with the national "ex-gay" movement peaked
with his founding of the Phoenix chapter of Homosexuals Anonymous (HA) as well
as Free Indeed.  He has since abandoned his pulpit and now says that the ex-
gay movement is a fruitless effort based on deception.  "There's no reality
in it," he says, "I was selling a product, and my product was a lie."
  Headed up by national ministries like Exodus International and Courage, the
organizations of the ex-gay movement rely on the tenents of born-again
Christianity to convince disatisfied homosexuals -- usually young gay men who
are just coming out -- that they can shed their sexuality by suppressing their
sexual urges and embracing Christianity.  "We offer support to people who are
seeking to leave the sin of homosexuality," explains Bob Davies, director of
Exodus.  He ventures that "about 80% of those seeking to abandon their homo-
sexuality are men."
  "Anybody who is involved in the ex-gay ministry is misguided and is wasting
their time," says Lisa Seeley, a former "redeemed lesbian" who worked with
Caligiuri as HA and appeared with him on the Sally Jessy Raphael show.  "These
organizations are for people who are spiritually and emotionally wounded."
  "It's possible to change your identity or your behavior," says sex educator
Brian McNaught, author of _On Being Gay_. "But it's really impossible to
change your orientation.  These people are no longer calling themselves gay,
but they continue to have same-sex erotic feelings."
  Caligiuri says he founded Free Indeed after an ominous week in 1981 when all
hell broke loose in his personal life.  A few days after his lover ended both
their romance and their business partnership, Caligiuri was sexually assaulted
by a man he picked up in a bar.  "I was really drunk," he recalls, "and I
went home with this guy.  He tied me up and raped me.  He left me tied up all
night, and the next morning he raped me again."
  When Caligiuri was eventually freed by the attacker, he returned home to the
home he shared with his ex-lover.  "He had another man there with him,"
Caligiuri recalls.  "I thought at this time, 'If this is what being gay is
about, I don't want to be this way anymore."
  Caligiuri vowed that if he could find a way out, he would share his discovery
with others.  He organized an antigay contingent to demonstrate at Phoenix's
gay pride parade in June 1985, and a few months later Free Indeed held its
first public protest.  At a meeting to promote a gay civil rights ordinance,
Free Indeed members loudly blasted gays, telling them ther were sinners headed
for hell.
  Free Indeed began receiving about a hundred telephone calls a week, thanks
in part to a deceptive listing in the local yellow pages.  "We were listed
under Lesbian and Gay Alternative Services," Caligiuri says, "so people
thought we were a gay information switchboard.  People would call to find out
where the local bars were, and we'd preach to them about the sins of homo-
sexuality."  Ruses like this are typical of the movement, Caligiuri says,
adding, "They'll do anything to reach these people."
  "David used to go on radio and say really stupid things," recalls Peter
Kelly, a counselor at Phoenix's Catholic diocese AIDS program, "like that
he knew he was gay when he started wearing pastel colors."
  Caligiuri's family first found out about his ministry when they saw him on
Raphael's syndicated talk show in 1985.  "They were relieved," he recalls.
"They figured that if they had to have a gay person in the family, better
that I should be a 'reformed' gay person."
  But Caligiuri was hardly reformed.  "By the time I appeared on Sally's
show," "I'd started having sex with men again.  Men would call our hotline
and tell me about thier latest sin: sex with their pastor, sex with their
father.  I was horny all the time."
  Unable to risk going to gay bars, where he might be recognized from his
numerous television appearances, Caligiuri says he "used to go to bookstores
and get blowjobs."  When he wasn't working the bookstores, he was sleeping
with other "reformed" homosexuals.
  "I didn't realize it at first, but a lot of the HA leaders were having sex
with one another," Caligiuri says.  "We'd go to conferences in other cities,
and we'd be paired up in hotel rooms.  Everybody was sleeping with everybody
else."
  By the time he appeared on 'AM Philadelphia' television show in May 1988,
Caligiuri was having anonymous sex a couple times a week.  When the show's
host asked him if he ever "acted on temptation," his answer was a lie.
  Caligiuri's duplicity began to take it's toll on him, however.  He was
suffering from chrinic fatigue syndrome and candidiasis, a dibilitating
yeast infection, and this led to his escape from the sect.  "I was too sick
to go to church," he explains.  "The more time I spent away from those people
the more I began to feel like myself.  I began to remember who I used to be."
  Late in 1991, Caligiuri turned Free Indeed phone lines over to a local
church and closed the ministry's doors.  "I'd convinced myself that there
is no need in the world for ex-gay people," he says.
  Today, Caligiuri, 31, is studying alternative spiritualities ("I'm interest-
ed in belief systems that aren't judgemental."), considering romance ("But
not with a CHristian!"), and searching for a new project to devote himself to.
"I feel compelled to commit myself to gay causes," he says.  "I want to
eventually stop feeling guilty about what I did and make up for the damage I
may have brought to our community."

---end article---

Caligiuri's tory is by no means unique and I have read several other articles
of former leaders and founders of 'ex-gay' ministries who have said very similar th
similar things.  Fortuantely not all of them have left Christianity, but have
come to realize that God loves them despite the attitudes of others.  Some,
like Chris Glaser, director of the Presbyterian "Lazarus Project" of West
Hollywood Presbyterian Church have actually been working with the gay community
to bring them into the sheepfold of Christ and encouraging real ethical values
of sexuality within the sphere of being gay.  I have also, as I said talked and become
and become close friends with many who once attended such groups as "Love In
Action" and others, who either once claimed to have been "reformed" or who
were too honest with themselves to live a lie, no matter who was disappointed
in them.  Some were even encouraged to marry as a way of "sealing" their
new heterosexuality, only to eventually start hitting the bars, bathhouses
and bookstores, since these were usually activities under the concealment of
night and one-night-stands of promiscuous behavior meant no continuous "sin"
through a committed relationship.  This is a horrible trap which the CHurch
has dumped on the backs of the truly gay oriented people, and the very inno-
cent victims in these cases are the wives and children of such marriages.  Yet
the church insists that there are only two options they are willing to allow
gay people: 1) heterosexuality or 2) celebacy.  This is sad.  What is also
mrtifying, is in the cases of those who cannot suppress their desires and
fear for thier sanity in such a mixed up confusion that the church forces on
them, they may even opt for 'suicide' or surgical dampering of the brain
functions.  In the past lobotomies and heavey drug suppressants were common-
place.  There are now becoming available more and more literature on the
threat of coercive Christianity toward gays, such as Sylvia Pennington's
_"Ex-Gays?  There Are None_. and others.  There are also a great many fact
based books being written to help people trapped in this confusion such as
Maury Johnston's _Gays Under Grace_, and Chris Glaser's _Come Hom!_.  I
seriously recommend those for people seeking help for this persecution and
self-acceptance.

Thank you.

Hi. I have been thinking about buying a Motorcycle or a while now and I have
some questions:

-Is there a buying guide for new/used motorcycles (that lists reliability, how
to go about the buying process, what to look for, etc...)?
-Is there a pricing guide for new/used motorcycles (Blue Book)?

Also
-Are there any books/articles on riding cross country, motorcycle camping, etc?
-Is there an idiots' guide to motorcycles?

ANY related information is helpful. Please respond directly to me.

Thanks a lot.

As a matter of fact, yes I do or at least I strive to.  I will not
be so proud as to boast that my faith is 100%.  I am still human
and imperfect and therefore, liable to sin.  Thankfully, there is
opportunity for repentence and forgiveness.

Will someone tell an ignorant physicist where the term "Level 5" comes
from? It sounds like the RISKS Digest  equivalent of Large, Extra
Large, Jumbo... Or maybe it's like "Defcon 5..."

I gather it means that Shuttle software was developed with extreme

the computing world is Level 1, or cheesy dime-store software.  Not
surprising.  But who is it that invents this standard, and how come

 Sigha.
 
 1) Trying to figure out a way to put a halogen beam on my CB360T... Are 
there any easy ways to do this (i.e. a "slip-in" bulb replacement)?
 
 2) Was told by a guy at the bike shop that my "not damn near bright enough" 
incandescent beam might be caused by a perma-low battery. So I went and 
picked up this cheapo "Motorcycle battery and charging system tester"... 
Hook it up to the battery, it's got 3 lights on "Very good charge"... Start 
the engine (to test the charging system), and it doesn't even REGISTER. It's 
supposed to light 5 or 6 lights if everything is OK, but it stays down at 
the same point as just the battery.
 
 My question here is, if indeed my charging system is just plain messed up, 
how the HECK is the battery staying fully charged? I'd think it would be 
darned near dead from supporting my lights, etc...
 
 Do the '75 CB360T's have a problem with their charging system? Are they 
just generally slower charging than what is normal for bigger bikes?
 
 Is there an easy fix for this?
 
 3) Happy noise: Put 300 miles on my bike this weekend, finally got myass an

Never said you didn't publish, merely that there is data you don't

IBM research  publishes plenty, it's why you ended up  with 2 Nobel

Old pioneer song from the 1850's or so goes as follows:
  
  "In a cavern, in a canyon,
   Excavating for a mine,
   Dwelt a miner, forty-niner,
   And his daughter, CLEMENTINE"
  
Chorus:
  "Oh my darling, Oh my darling,
   Oh my darling Clementine.
   You are lost and gone forever,
   Oh my darling Clementine."
  
 I've also had it explained (but not confirmed from a reliable data
source) that CLEMENTINE is an acronym.  Something like Combined
Lunar Elemental Mapper Experiment on Extended Non Terrestrial
Intercept Near Earth.  Personally, I think that acronym was made up
to fit the name (if it really is an acronym).

I don't think you're going to be able to see the differences from a sphere
unless they are greatly exaggerated.  Even the equatorial bulge is only
about 1 part in 300 -- you'd never notice a 1mm error in a 30cm globe --
and the other deviations from spherical shape are much smaller.

Greetings netters,

Steve writes ... <about Cobra Locks>

Well I have the mother of all locks. On Friday the 16th of April I took
possesion of a 12' Cobra Links lock, 1" diameter. This was a special order.

I weighs a lot. I had to carry it home and it was digging into my shoulder
after about two blocks.

I have currently a Kryptonite Rock Lock through the front wheel, a HD
padlock for the steering lock, a Master padlock to lock the cover to two
front spokes, and the Cobra Links through the rear swing arm and around a
post in an underground parking garage.

Next Friday the 30th I have an appointment to have an alarm installed on
me bike.

When I travel the Cobra Links and the cover and padlock stay at home.

By the way. I also removed the plastic mesh that is on the Cobra Links
and encased the lock from end to end using bicycle inner tubes (two of
them) I got the from bicycle dealer that sold me the Cobra Links. The
guys were really great and didn't mark up the price of the lock much
and the inner tubes were free.

Later.

American, perhaps, but nothing military about it.  I learned (mostly)
slugs when we talked English units in high school physics and while
the teacher was an ex-Navy fighter jock the book certainly wasn't
produced by the military.

[Poundals were just too flinking small and made the math come out
funny; sort of the same reason proponents of SI give for using that.]

Once again, where's your proof? Suicide is considered a sin by Branch
Davidians.  Also, Koresh said over and over again that he was not going to
commit suicide.  Furthermore, all the cult experts said that he was not
suicidal.  David Thibedeau (sp?), one of the cult members, said that the fire
was started when one of the tanks spraying the tear gas into the facilities
knocked over a lantern.

I'd like to point out that the Bible says "Do not commit murder." The NKJ
translation mistranslates.  Self-defense was never considered murder.  The
reason why they were stockpiling weapons is because they were afraid the
government would try something.  Their fears were obviously well founded.

Suppose the Soviets had managed to get their moon rocket working
and had made it first.  They could have beaten us if either:

* Their rocket hadn't blown up on the pad thus setting them back,

and/or

* A Saturn V went boom.

If they had beaten us, I speculate that the US would have gone
head and done some landings, but we also would have been more
determined to set up a base (both in Earth Orbit and on the
Moon).  Whether or not we would be on Mars by now would depend
upon whether the Soviets tried to go.  Setting up a lunar base
would have stretched the budgets of both nations and I think
that the military value of a lunar base would outweigh the value
of going to Mars (at least in the short run).  Thus we would
have concentrated on the moon.

Your last remark is a contradiction, but I'll let that pass.

I was addressing the notion of the Great Commission, which
you deleted in order to provide us with dull little homilies.
Thank you, Bing Crosby.  Now you go right on back to sleep
and mommy and daddy will tuck you in later.

Oh, and how convenient his bible must have been to Michael
Griffin, how convenient his Christianity.  "Well, I'll just
skip the bit about not murdering people and loving the sinner
and hating the sin and all that other stuff for now and
concentrate on the part where it says that if someone is doing
something wrong, you should shoot him in the back several times
as he tries to hobble away on his crutches."

I'll leave the "convert or die" program of the missionaries and
their military escorts in the Americas for Nadja to explain as
she knows much more about it than I.

Must be awfully convenient, by the way, to offer platitudes
as you have done, David, rather than addressing the arguments.

Well, you might try the A.R.R.L.'s license study guides. For example, my

  Robert, you keep making references to "orthodox" belief, and saying things
like "it is held that..." (cf. "Kermit" thread).  On what exact body of
theology are you drawing for what you call "orthodox?"  Who is that "holds
that" Luke meant what you said he meant?  Whenever your personal interpretation
of Biblical passages is challenged, your only response seems
to be that one needs merely to "look at the Bible" in order to see the truth,

Maddison and Hamilton were both studying existing forms of government for
several years before they wrote the federalist papers. That the US system
is based to a considerable degree on the UK model is pretty widely accepted.
At the time there was no other major country with a representative body.
The French plebicite had been suppressed for 140 years and its restoration
eight years later would mark the start of the French revolution. 

After the UK system the major influences were the Dutch system and of course
the classical systems. Nobody seriously suggests that Rome or Greece were 
models though because the political systems of both countries were acknowleged
disasters. The main lesson learnt from Greece was that unless a federal
state was constructed a war would be inevitable. The Greek democracies were
always fighting amongst themselves which is how Rome managed to invade. Had
the federal consitution been rejected the new Roman empire in the shape of
Britain would quite certainly have reabsorbed much of the colonies in due
course. Moreover the states would have been at each others throats as soon
as the Louisiana purchase situation arose during the Napoleonic period.

Very simple.  An 'Insurance Commissioner' is a bureaucrat - a regulator.
It is his/her duties to make rules to enforce laws.  He/she cannot
make laws.  If there is no law that covers a specific subject, say
scam insurance companies, a regulator cannot create one.  So they have
to go to a proper legislative body to get such a law enacted.  For
the California Insurance Commissioner, there are two possible legislative
bodies:  the California State Legislature and the U.S. Congress.  We all
know how little the California State Legislature accomplishes, esp. 
along the lines of insurance reform legislation (negative movement).  So
Garamendi wants the feds to do it, because: (a) he has a better chance
of getting a federal law through, and (b) since many of the scam
companies work across state lines/national borders, it is better to
have a law that reach out into other jurisdictions.

51 Arrested for Defying Judge's Order at Abortion Protest Rally
The Miami Herald, April 11, 1993

   Melbourne, Florida --   [...]

   Circuit Judge Robert McGregor's order prohibits anti-abortion pickets
   within 36 feet of the property line of Aware Woman Center for Choice.
   Even across the street, they may not display pictures of dead fetuses
   or sing or chant loud enough to be heard by patients inside the clinic.

   The protesters say the ruling all but wiped out the First Amendment
   to the Constitution.

   ``This is our sidewalk,'' said Joe Carroll, 33, a landscaper who
   marched with his children, Mary Grace, 8, and John, 7.

   ``I am not a rescuer.  I am not a trespasser.  It's just that this is
   my sidewalk.  I am not really protesting abortion.  We are protesting
   denial of our rights of assembly, religion, speech.  This judge is
   trashing the Constitution.''

   The children's grandmother led them away, sobbing, as Carroll and
   his father were arrested.

   Outside the clinic, Eleanor Smeal, president of the Washington,
   D.C.-based Feminist Majority Foundation, called for the Florida
   Legislature and Congress to pass laws as tough as the judge's
   order, which covers only Brevard and Seminole counties.

   ``This cannot go on,'' she said.  ``This is not freedom of speech,
   this is total psychological warfare with violence.  It is ridiculous
   to have to ask clinics to go court-by-court . . . to get protection.''

                     MAGELLAN STATUS REPORT
                         April 23, 1993

1.  The Magellan spacecraft continues to operate normally, gathering
gravity data to plot the density variations of Venus in the
mid-latitudes.  The solar panel offpoint was returned to zero degrees
and spacecraft temperatures dropped 2-3 degrees C.

2.  An end-to-end test of the Delayed Aerobraking Data readout
process was conducted this week in preparation for the Transition
Experiment.  There was some difficulty locking up to the data frames,
and engineers are presently checking whether the problem was in
equipment at the tracking station.

3.  Magellan has completed 7277 orbits of Venus and is now 32 days
from the end of Cycle 4 and the start of the Transition Experiment.

4.  Magellan scientists were participating in the Brown-Vernadsky
Microsymposium at Brown University in Providence, RI, this week.  This
joint meeting of U.S. and Russian Venus researchers has been
continuing for many years.

5.  A three-day simulation of Transition Experiment aerobraking
activities is planned for next week, including Orbit Trim Maneuvers
and Starcal (Star calibration) Orbits.

What a great day! Got back home last night from some fantastic skiing
in Colorado, and put the battery back in the FXSTC. Cleaned the plugs,
opened up the petcock, waited a minute, hit the starter, and bingo it
started up like a charm! Spent a restless night anticipating the first
ride du saison, and off I went this morning to get my state inspection
done. Now my bike is stock (so far) except for HD slash-cut pipes, and
all went well with my New Hampshire State Inspection (meaning all my
lights worked OK) until the dude produces a decibel meter and tells me
about the new NH law about MC noise.....huh?  sez I....and he has me
start her up and rev to about 3000 rpm....I FAIL cuz I register 120 DB,
and the max allowed is 110! If I fail with these pipes, there are gonna
be a whole lotta seriously pissed off bikers round here when they go
for inspection.

*&%^*$%*^*%*&

But hey, its a new experience! I have never really felt like a menace
to society before! I parked, dismounted and walked in to my building
with a slight swagger to my step, and a narrow lidded look... I sensed
my faculty colleagues unease with my new intimidating status...and
women's glances seemed to linger just a little longer....or perhaps
that was my imagination.......*sigh*

Now I need to install my new BUB pipes and single fire ignition....I
wonder how I will do after that!?

I plan to go.  It's about 30 minutes away from my home.
I can report on some of it (from my perspective ...)
Anyone else on sci.space going to be there?  If so, send me

I'll maintain a list of who's going.

Undoubtedly.  In fact, it is the fact that hospitals frequently compete
for physicians rather than for patients that (in part) complicates and 
undermines a simplistic free-market analysis of the market for medical care.

>Hospitals tend to lose money on all sorts of high-tech, high-price 
>machinery. They manage to make it up on other charges.

Once again, there is no evidence that this is true in regard to kidney
dialysis.  Although price controls have promoted an expansion of services
to a much greater volume of patients, RD is still a profitable service.
Otherwise, one would expect to see evidence of rationing rather than the
vast expansion that has occurred.

Can you spell "loss leader?"  I knew you could.  Grocery stores do not
attempt to make up the loss on an individual product by selling more of
it.  In fact, your argument above is that kidney dialysis is a loss leader 
for other medical treatments where lost revenue can be regained.  

But the evidence does not support this contention.  Rather, it appears that
price controls have disciplined the market by forcing an expansion of
service and development of improved lower-cost technology to provide 
comparable benefits.  Providers continue to profit from RD, they simply
make less on each treatment than they would have if the price had 
risen at the rate that uncontrolled treatments have.

There is no question that had price controls forced the price of RD 
substantially below its actual cost that some or all of the doomsday
predictions of free-market advocates would have been seen -- restriction
of service, lagging technological development, etc.  Likewise, it appears
that in the VA and armed forces medical care systems, where providers 
are government agencies, some of these negative impacts may occur.  
(RD patients in the VA system in Spokane, for example, must travel to
Seattle, 300 miles away, for treatment.)  

The bottom line, however, is that this is an example of government 
intervention (of a rather extreme sort) that appears to have had beneficial
results for both providers and consumers.  Claims that "government
bureaucracy" inevitably leads to undesirable outcomes in the marketplace
should take such such cases into account.

That happens to be a subjective example that the people of the
US would happen to agree on.  Continue to move the price up; 
at some point a few people would accept then more then more until 
probably all would accept at a high enough number.

Endpoints of a subjective scale are not the given homes of 
objective viewpoints.

Re: RMS readings

Unless the DVM *says* it's measuring RMS, it's probably Average voltage.
The input is diode rectified and measured as DC.  If it says it's RMS
and but measures square/triangle/etc.  incorrectly, it's measuring
average and multipling by a correction that's *only* true for sine waves
(i.e.  Vave*(0.707/0.63) = Vrms).  If you want correct RMS for (most)
any waveform, you need a "True-RMS" DVM/DMM which literally does the
Root-Mean-Square calculation in either analog or digital circuitry.

:

: analog ones? 

The last significant advantage of analog (IMO) ** was ** being able to
"see" the signal if it was changing over time (e.g.  checking
electrolytic capacitors).

Anymore, most DMM have bargraphs, etc. that duplicate this.

I'll post a summary after I get enough information.  I'll include
tips like "how to know when the monkey is pulling your leg".  Shouldn't
monkey's have to be bonded and insured before they work on bikes?

 Not quite.  The answer is:  Many homosexuals, heterosexual, and bisexuals are,
but then, many are not.

 Or, more simply: Lots of people are.

You're admitting a lot more than that.  You are admitting that
your morals are situational.   You are admitting that the actions
of other people and the situation you are in help to determine
how you judge the moral significance of one of your own actions.

If you employ X degree of force, that's not moral, but if you employ
X degree of force, but previously someone else has employed Y degree
of force, and the situation is thus-and-so, that *is* moral.

This is quite different from saying "Employing force on other people
is immoral, period.   Unfortunately, from time to time we are obliged
to do this immoral thing for reasons of self-preservation, and so
we have to bear the moral consequences of that.

For what it's worth - and yes, I know you claim to be an agnostic -
it's this ability to re-label things from "immoral" to "moral" 
that I find one of the *least* attractive qualities of the religious
mind.

Well, this is my second try at posting on this subject. Here goes...
	In Texas (Corpus Christi at least) if you pick up the phone and dial

As for SF and advertising in space. There is a romantic episode
in Mead's "The Big Ball of Wax" where the lovers are watching 
the constellation Pepsi Cola rising over the horizon and noting
the some 'stars' had slipped cause the Teamsters were on strike.

This was the inspiration for my article on orbiting a formation
of space mirrors published in Spaceflight in 1986. As the reviews
said: this seems technically feasible, and could be commercially viable
but is it aesthetically desirable?  These days the only aesthetics
that count are the ones you can count!

The pricing of parts reminds me of something a chemist once said to me:

"A gram of this dye costs a dollar.
It comes out of a liter jar which also costs a dollar.
And if you want a whole barrel of it, that also costs a dollar."

I.e., they charge you almost exclusively for packaging it and delivering
it to you -- the chemical itself (in that particular case) was a byproduct
that cost almost nothing intrinsically.

One thing to consider is time division multiplexing the EMG
channels to reduce the number of RF carriers you have to generate.
If you multiplexed the EMG inputs at 10KHz, that would probably be
sufficient for most physiology studies (you'd have ~ 330 Hz per
channel sampling rate.)  That level of analog multiplexing should
be rather easy to accomplish.

Combining a lot of RF carriers is pretty tricky to do without
generating intermodulation.  A system to be carried by a runner is
in a fairly harsh environment and would probably be difficult to
keep balanced.

A commercial hand-held transciever could probably be employed with
a little modification to accomodate widening the bandwidth.
Obviously, this has to be done in accordance with whatever laws
govern the use of transeivers in your location.

	But, I exclaim, " No, you won't! "

	This is only for that poor 37 million who have none.  Not for

	Plus, all that extra "corporate and rich" taxes that will

I dunno, on my old GS1000E the tank-seat junction was nice and smooth.
But if you were to travel all the way forward, you'd collect the top
triple-clamp in a sensitive area. I'd hate to have to make the choice,
but I think I'd prefer the FJ's gas tank. :-)

Any lunar satellite needs fuel to do regular orbit corrections, and when
its fuel runs out it will crash within months.  The orbits of the Apollo
motherships changed noticeably during lunar missions lasting only a few
days.  It is *possible* that there are stable orbits here and there --
the Moon's gravitational field is poorly mapped -- but we know of none.

Perturbations from Sun and Earth are relatively minor issues at low
altitudes.  The big problem is that the Moon's own gravitational field
is quite lumpy due to the irregular distribution of mass within the Moon.

Put the pack on the pillion and bungee it to the backrest.
If that is not possible then you should be able to bungee it behind the
backrest, just make sure it doesn't bend or break anything like the rear
fender or turnsignals.

Hey, man, you brought it up.  I agree completely, driving drunk is really
stupid, and I understand and appreciate that you feel bad about it.  But
DWI is endemic in our society.  It is a REAL problem.  And we, as 
motorcyclists, can be in the worst of vulnerable positions around a drunk
driver.  (Alert readers might remember that last year I witnessed a DWI
accident (right bloody in front of me), and was unable to save the life 
of one of the participants, as I reported here.)  Also, drunk driving by
motorcyclists is a prime cause of their injury and death, which raises the
insurance rates, forces stupidly restrictive laws, and turns the public
against those of us who ride responsibly.

In my view, drunk driving should carry a mandatory prison sentence.
It is one of the traffic offenses which is NOT a public funds issue,
but a genuine safety issue.  So if YOU bring up the subject on rec.moto,
admitting having been caught DWI, and looking for sympathy over the 
consequences, don't expect people to respond with warm wishes.

HOW TO BECOME AN ASTRONAUT

    First the short form, authored by Henry Spencer, then an official NASA
    announcement.

    Q. How do I become an astronaut?

    A. We will assume you mean a NASA astronaut, since it's probably
    impossible for a non-Russian to get into the cosmonaut corps (paying
    passengers are not professional cosmonauts), and the other nations have
    so few astronauts (and fly even fewer) that you're better off hoping to
    win a lottery. Becoming a shuttle pilot requires lots of fast-jet
    experience, which means a military flying career; forget that unless you
    want to do it anyway. So you want to become a shuttle "mission
    specialist".

    If you aren't a US citizen, become one; that is a must.  After that,
    the crucial thing to remember is that the demand for such jobs vastly
    exceeds the supply.  NASA's problem is not finding qualified people,
    but thinning the lineup down to manageable length.	It is not enough
    to be qualified; you must avoid being *dis*qualified for any reason,
    many of them in principle quite irrelevant to the job.

    Get a Ph.D.  Specialize in something that involves getting your hands
    dirty with equipment, not just paper and pencil.  Forget computer
    programming entirely; it will be done from the ground for the fore-
    seeable future.  Degree(s) in one field plus work experience in
    another seems to be a frequent winner.

    Be in good physical condition, with good eyesight.	(DO NOT get a
    radial keratomy or similar hack to improve your vision; nobody knows
    what sudden pressure changes would do to RKed eyes, and long-term
    effects are poorly understood.  For that matter, avoid any other
    significant medical unknowns.)  If you can pass a jet-pilot physical,
    you should be okay; if you can't, your chances are poor.

    Practise public speaking, and be conservative and conformist in
    appearance and actions; you've got a tough selling job ahead, trying
    to convince a cautious, conservative selection committee that you
    are better than hundreds of other applicants.  (And, also, that you
    will be a credit to NASA after you are hired:  public relations is
    a significant part of the job, and NASA's image is very prim and
    proper.)  The image you want is squeaky-clean workaholic yuppie.
    Remember also that you will need a security clearance at some point,
    and Security considers everybody guilty until proven innocent.
    Keep your nose clean.

    Get a pilot's license and make flying your number one hobby;
    experienced pilots are known to be favored even for non-pilot jobs.

    Work for NASA; of 45 astronauts selected between 1984 and 1988,
    43 were military or NASA employees, and the remaining two were
    a NASA consultant and Mae Jemison (the first black female astronaut).
    If you apply from outside NASA and miss, but they offer you a job
    at NASA, ***TAKE IT***; sometimes in the past this has meant "you
    do look interesting but we want to know you a bit better first".

    Think space:  they want highly motivated people, so lose no chance
    to demonstrate motivation.

    Keep trying.  Many astronauts didn't make it the first time.




    NASA
    National Aeronautics and Space Administration
    Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center
    Houston, Texas

    Announcement for Mission Specialist and Pilot Astronaut Candidates
    ==================================================================

    Astronaut Candidate Program
    ---------------------------

    The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has a need for
    Pilot Astronaut Candidates and Mission Specialist Astronaut Candidates
    to support the Space Shuttle Program. NASA is now accepting on a
    continuous basis and plans to select astronaut candidates as needed.

    Persons from both the civilian sector and the military services will be
    considered.

    All positions are located at the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in
    Houston, Texas, and will involved a 1-year training and evaluation
    program.

    Space Shuttle Program Description
    ---------------------------------

    The numerous successful flights of the Space Shuttle have demonstrated
    that operation and experimental investigations in space are becoming
    routine. The Space Shuttle Orbiter is launched into, and maneuvers in
    the Earth orbit performing missions lastling up to 30 days. It then
    returns to earth and is ready for another flight with payloads and
    flight crew.

    The Orbiter performs a variety of orbital missions including deployment
    and retrieval of satellites, service of existing satellites, operation
    of specialized laboratories (astronomy, earth sciences, materials
    processing, manufacturing), and other operations. These missions will
    eventually include the development and servicing of a permanent space
    station. The Orbiter also provides a staging capability for using higher
    orbits than can be achieved by the Orbiter itself. Users of the Space
    Shuttle's capabilities are both domestic and foreign and include
    government agencies and private industries.

    The crew normally consists of five people - the commander, the pilot,
    and three mission specialists. On occasion additional crew members are
    assigned. The commander, pilot, and mission specialists are NASA
    astronauts.

    Pilot Astronaut

    Pilot astronauts server as both Space Shuttle commanders and pilots.
    During flight the commander has onboard responsibility for the vehicle,
    crew, mission success and safety in flight. The pilot assists the
    commander in controlling and operating the vehicle. In addition, the
    pilot may assist in the deployment and retrieval of satellites utilizing
    the remote manipulator system, in extra-vehicular activities, and other
    payload operations.

    Mission Specialist Astronaut

    Mission specialist astronauts, working with the commander and pilot,
    have overall responsibility for the coordination of Shuttle operations
    in the areas of crew activity planning, consumables usage, and
    experiment and payload operations. Mission specialists are required to
    have a detailed knowledge of Shuttle systems, as well as detailed
    knowledge of the operational characteristics, mission requirements and
    objectives, and supporting systems and equipment for each of the
    experiments to be conducted on their assigned missions. Mission
    specialists will perform extra-vehicular activities, payload handling
    using the remote manipulator system, and perform or assist in specific
    experimental operations.

	Medical Technology, etc.)
      - Degrees in Psychology (except for Clinical Psychology, Physiological
	Psychology, or Experimental Psychology which are qualifying).
      - Degrees in Nursing.
      - Degrees in social sciences (Geography, Anthropology, Archaeology, etc.)
      - Degrees in Aviation, Aviation Management or similar fields.

    Application Procedures
    ----------------------

    Civilian

    The application package may be obtained by writing to:

	NASA Johnson Space Center
	Astronaut Selection Office
	ATTN: AHX
	Houston, TX 77058

    Civilian applications will be accepted on a continuous basis. When NASA
    decides to select additional astronaut candidates, consideration will be
    given only to those applications on hand on the date of decision is
    made. Applications received after that date will be retained and
    considered for the next selection. Applicants will be notified annually
    of the opportunity to update their applications and to indicate
    continued interest in being considered for the program. Those applicants
    who do not update their applications annually will be dropped from
    consideration, and their applications will not be retained. After the
    preliminary screening of applications, additional information may be
    requested for some applicants, and person listed on the application as
    supervisors and references may be contacted.

    Active Duty Military

    Active duty military personnel must submit applications to their
    respective military service and not directly to NASA. Application
    procedures will be disseminated by each service.

    Selection
    ---------

    Personal interviews and thorough medical evaluations will be required
    for both civilian and military applicants under final consideration.
    Once final selections have been made, all applicants who were considered
    will be notified of the outcome of the process.

    Selection rosters established through this process may be used for the
    selection of additional candidates during a one year period following
    their establishment.

    General Program Requirements

    Selected applicants will be designated Astronaut Candidates and will be
    assigned to the Astronaut Office at the Johnson Space Center, Houston,
    Texas. The astronaut candidates will undergo a 1 year training and
    evaluation period during which time they will be assigned technical or
    scientific responsibilities allowing them to contribute substantially to
    ongoing programs. They will also participate in the basic astronaut
    training program which is designed to develop the knowledge and skills
    required for formal mission training upon selection for a flight. Pilot
    astronaut candidates will maintain proficiency in NASA aircraft during
    their candidate period.

    Applicants should be aware that selection as an astronaut candidate does
    not insure selection as an astronaut. Final selection as an astronaut
    will depend on satisfactory completion of the 1 year training and
    evaluation period. Civilian candidates who successfully complete the
    training and evaluation and are selected as astronauts will become
    permanent Federal employees and will be expected to remain with NASA for
    a period of at least five years. Civilian candidates who are not
    selected as astronauts may be placed in other positions within NASA
    depending upon Agency requirements and manpower constraints at that
    time. Successful military candidates will be detailed to NASA for a
    specified tour of duty.

    NASA has an affirmative action program goal of having qualified
    minorities and women among those qualified as astronaut candidates.
    Therefore, qualified minorities and women are encouraged to apply.

    Pay and Benefits
    ----------------

    Civilians

    Salaries for civilian astronaut candidates are based on the Federal
    Governments General Schedule pay scales for grades GS-11 through GS-14,
    and are set in accordance with each individuals academic achievements
    and experience.

    Other benefits include vacation and sick leave, a retirement plan, and
    participation in group health and life insurance plans.

    Military

    Selected military personnel will be detailed to the Johnson Space Center
    but will remain in an active duty status for pay, benefits, leave, and
    other similar military matters.

   {Description of "External Tank" option for SSF redesign deleted}

>Mark proposed this design at Joe Shea's committee in Crystal City,
>and he reports that he was warmly received.  However, the rumors
>I hear say that a design based on a wingless Space Shuttle Orbiter
>seems more likely.

Yo Ken, let's keep on-top of things! Both the "External Tank" and
"Wingless Orbiter" options have been deleted from the SSF redesign
options list. Today's (4/23) edition of the New York Times reports
that O'Connor told the panel that some redesign proposals have
been dropped, such as using the "giant external fuel tanks used
in launching space shuttles," and building a "station around
an existing space shuttle with its wings and tail removed."

Currently, there are three options being considered, as presented
to the advisory panel meeting yesterday (and as reported in
today's Times).

Option "A" - Low Cost Modular Approach
This option is being studied by a team from MSFC. {As an aside,
there are SSF redesign teams at MSFC, JSC, and LaRC supporting
the SRT (Station Redesign Team) in Crystal City. Both LeRC and
Reston folks are also on-site at these locations, helping the respective
teams with their redesign activities.} Key features of this
option are:
  -  Uses "Bus-1", a modular bus developed by Lockheed that's
     qualified for STS and ELV's. The bus provides propulsion, GN&C
     Communications, & Data Management. Lockheed developed this
     for the Air Force.
  -  A "Power Station Capability" is obtained in 3 Shuttle Flights.
     SSF Solar arrays are used to provide 20 kW of power. The vehicle
     flies in an "arrow mode" to optimize the microgravity environment.
     Shuttle/Spacelab missions would utilize the vehilce as a power
     source for 30 day missions.
  -  Human tended capability (as opposed to the old SSF sexist term
     of man-tended capability) is achieved by the addition of the
     US Common module. This is a modified version of the existing
     SSF Lab module (docking ports are added for the International
     Partners' labs, taking the place of the nodes on SSF). The
     Shuttle can be docked to the station for 60 day missions.
     The Orbiter would provide crew habitability & EVA capability.
  -  International Human Tended. Add the NASDA & ESA modules, and
     add another 20 kW of power
  -  Permanent Human Presence Capability. Add a 3rd power module,
     the U.S. habitation module, and an ACRV (Assured Crew Return
     Vehicle).

Option "B" - Space Station Freedom Derived
The Option "B" team is based at LaRC, and is lead by Mike Griffin.
This option looks alot like the existing SSF design, which we
have all come to know and love :)

This option assumes a lightweight external tank is available for
use on all SSF assembly flights (so does option "A"). Also, the 
number of flights is computed for a 51.6 inclination orbit,
for both options "A" and "B".

The build-up occurs in six phases:
  -  Initial Research Capability reached after 3 flights. Power
     is transferred from the vehicle to the Orbiter/Spacelab, when
     it visits.
  -  Man-Tended Capability (Griffin has not yet adopted non-sexist
     language) is achieved after 8 flights. The U.S. Lab is
     deployed, and 1 solar power module provides 20 kW of power.
  -  Permanent Human Presence Capability occurs after 10 flights, by
     keeping one Orbiter on-orbit to use as an ACRV (so sometimes
     there would be two Orbiters on-orbit - the ACRV, and the
     second one that comes up for Logistics & Re-supply).
  -  A "Two Fault Tolerance Capability" is achieved after 14 flights,
     with the addition of a 2nd power module, another thermal
     control system radiator, and more propulsion modules.
  -  After 20 flights, the Internationals are on-board. More power,
     the Habitation module, and an ACRV are added to finish the
     assembly in 24 flights.

Most of the systems currently on SSF are used as-is in this option, 
with the exception of the data management system, which has major
changes.

Option C - Single Core Launch Station.
This is the JSC lead option. Basically, you take a 23 ft diameter
cylinder that's 92 ft long, slap 3 Space Shuttle Main Engines on
the backside, put a nose cone on the top, attached it to a 
regular shuttle external tank and a regular set of solid rocket
motors, and launch the can. Some key features are:
  - Complete end-to-end ground integration and checkout
  - 4 tangentially mounted fixed solar panels
  - body mounted radiators (which adds protection against
    micrometeroid & orbital debris)
  - 2 centerline docking ports (one on each end)
  - 7 berthing ports
  - a single pressurized volume, approximately 26,000 cubic feet
    (twice the volume of skylab).
  - 7 floors, center passageway between floors
  - 10 kW of housekeeping power
  - graceful degradation with failures (8 power channels, 4 thermal
    loops, dual environmental control & life support system)
  - increased crew time for utilization
  - 1 micro-g thru out the core module


While driving through the middle of nowhere, I picked up KNBR, AM 1070,
a clear-channel station based in Los Angeles. They had an ad 
claiming that they were able to get traffic flow information from 
all of the thousands of traffic sensors that CalTrans has placed
under the pavement. Does CalTrans sell this info? Does KNBR have
an exclusive? What's the deal?

                         THE WHITE HOUSE

                  Office of the Press Secretary
                 (Vancouver, British Columbia) 
______________________________________________________________


                       BACKGROUND BRIEFING
                               BY
                 SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS


                          April 4, 1993
	     
                          Canada Place
                  Vancouver, British Columbia  


9:40 A.M. PST
	     
	     
	     Folks, we're about to start the BACKGROUND BRIEFING 
on the aid package.

	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Good morning.  The 
President -- President Clinton and President Yeltsin agreed 
yesterday on a series of American initiatives to support economic 
and political reform in Russia, and it's valued at $1.6 billion.  

	     Before taking your questions and running through the 
basic outlines of this package, I want to make a few points.  
First, this is the maximum that the Clinton administration can do 
with available funds to support Russian reform.  All of the funds 
have been allocated and appropriated by the Congress.  There is 
no need for the administration to go back to the Congress to fund 
any of these programs.  All our Fiscal Year '93 funds currently 
are available, so in effect, all of these programs can begin 
tomorrow.
	     
	     The second point is that this package is designed to 
support Russian reformers.  All of the initiatives in the package 
are directed at reformers and for their benefit, and all have 
been worked out with prior consultation with the Russian 
government.
	     
	     Third, the President is determined that we will 
deliver on these commitments this year.  The package is designed 
to maximize our ability to support reform.  In designing it we 
wanted to avoid making commitments that we could not meet, and we 
feel very confident that we can meet all of these commitments in 
front of you.
	     
	     Fourth, I'd like to note the special importance of 
trade and investment.  I think it's fair to say that Russia's 
capital and technology needs throughout the next decade extend 
well into the hundreds of billions of dollars.  No collection of 
governments can meet those needs; only the private sector can do 
so.  And so the President and President Yeltsin agreed to make 
trade and investment a major priority in the relationship.  
	     
	     They also agreed that there would be a new joint 
commission on energy and space formed, headed on the U.S. side by 
Vice President Gore; on the Russian side by Prime Minister 
Chernomyrdin.  And the goal of this effort is to break through 
the barriers to trade and investment on both sides and to promote 
a vastly expanded relationship.
	     
	     If it would be helpful I'd be prepared to run down 
the first page, which is a summary of U.S. assistance, and just 
give you some general background on what these programs are.  
I'll do it quickly and then I'll be glad to take questions.
	     
	     The first group of initiatives are humanitarian food 
and medical assistance.  This is part of our effort which has 
been underway for several years to provide basic humanitarian 
grant food assistance so that the Russian government can assure 
there's at least a minimal amount of bread on the shelves in the 
major cities.  That's $194 million in grant -- that is from Food 
for Progress, the grant portion of Food for Progress.  We'll also 
be continuing our grant assistance in medicines and 
pharmaceutical supplies, and that's $30 million.
	     
	     The second item is concessional food sales.  As you 
know, the United States has had a long-term grain relationship 
with Russia.  It's important to us and it's important to Russia 
that we continue that relationship.  The President has chosen the 
Food for Progress program which is a concessional loan program.  
The value over the next seven months is $700 million.  These are 
concessional terms.  The exact terms have not been worked out, 
but I think it's fair to say there will be a grace period on 
principal of six or seven years, and concessional rates 
thereafter for the life of the deal.
	     
	     The third program is a collection of private sector 
support.  We think this is one of the most important things we're 
going to do.  Privatization and the creation of small businesses 
is the number one priority of the reform government in Moscow.  
And so the President has decided to create a Russian-American 
enterprise fund capitalized this year at $50 million.  And the 
goal of this fund is to make direct loans to small businesses in 
Russia, to take equity positions in those businesses.  
	     
	     The President has also decided to create a 
privatization fund which would work directly with the Russian 
government in its priority objective of trying to convert state 
enterprises from a state-owned basis to a private basis.  He has 
also agreed -- the President has also agreed to establish a 
Eurasia foundation.  This would be a private foundation led by 
prominent Americans to fund democratization projects in Russia.
	     
	     The fourth grouping you see there in the summary 
page is democratization itself.  I think it's fair to say that 
this administration has given a new impetus to the goal of 
pursuing democratization in Russia.  You see that we have a total 
of $48 million in programs, various programs.  The detailed 
tables give an indication of some of the programs that we're 
launching.  
	     
	     The President is also calling for the development of 
a democracy corps, which will be an overarching umbrella group to 
try to incorporate all of the disparate private and public 
efforts now underway from the United States to support reform in 
Russia.
	     
	     The fifth program you see is Russian office of 
resettlement.  This is a new initiative created and 
conceptualized by this administration.  This is a demonstration 
project.  What we'd like to do is work with the Russian military 
to help resettle Russian officers returning from the Baltic 
states and other parts of the former Soviet Union.  We want to 
make sure that we work out the best way to do that, whether it's 
with Russian labor and Russian materials or using prefab American 
construction.  And so we've decided to fund on a demonstration 
basis the construction of 450 housing units.  We'll be working 
very closely with the Russian military on this.  And I would say 
that we have a long-term commitment to this project.  
	     
	     The sixth area is energy in the environment.  They 
are two issues that the President feels strongly about.  Our 
initial efforts will be feasibility studies to look into the 
possibility of enhancing their energy production, both oil and 
gas; and equally important trying to cut down on the leakages in 
the oil and gas pipeline systems, which cause so much 
environmental damage.
	     
	     I've talked a little bit about trade and investment, 
about the new group being created that the Vice President will 
chair on our side.  Secretary Ron Brown will also be cochairing 
with Deputy Prime Minister Shohkin, a business development 
committee, which will work in all other sectors of the economy, 
to break down the many barriers that currently exist and impede 
trade and investment.  We are also going to appoint a full-time 
investment ombudsman in the American government to work on this 
problem full-time.  
	     
	     And the point I'd like to make here is, trade and 
investment in the 1990s is every bit as important, to draw an 
analogy, as arms reductions was in the '70s and '80s.  And we 
just thought that in looking at this we needed to make a 
commitment within our own government to have people work on it -- 
senior people on a full-time basis, because it is terribly 
important.
	     
	     You'll notice that the United States is going to 
support Russia's membership in the GATT.  Russia has had observer 
status.  Russia has requested our support and, in fact, requested 
our advice in becoming a member of the GATT.  We think that the 
long-term goal of drawing Russia into the global economy is 
paramount, a very important goal.  And that is why we are 
supporting the membership in the GATT.  We are also supporting 
their access to GSP, the Generalized System of Preferences.  
	     
	     You'll note that Ex-Im has extended $82 million in 
credit for a caterpillar deal in Siberia, that OPIC has extended 
$150 million in credits and loan guarantees for a Conoco oil 
project.  I'd like to emphasize that we are very close to an 
agreement between Russia and the United States for a $2-billion 
framework facility through the Ex-Im Bank that would finance 
Russian purchases of American oil and gas equipment and services. 
We think this is a very important development.  We think we'll 
get there by April 14th, which is the opening day of the Tokyo 
conference, the G-7 conference.
	     
	     Before I take any further questions, I'd like to 
defer to my colleague, who will review the security assistance 
objectives with you.
	     
	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Our major 
unfinished agenda with the Russians and with their counterparts 
in Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Belarus is in the area of the safe and 
secure dismantlement of the nuclear arsenals on their territory 
under the terms of the START I and START II agreements.   
Recently we completed in Moscow three, I think, very important 
agreements that devote a significant chunk of Nunn-Lugar funding 
to three important programs.  The first is the program of $130 
million for the strategic nuclear delivery vehicle dismantlement 
program.  That is for submarines, for ICBM dismantlement and for 
bomber dismantlement -- $130 million.
	     
	     The second is a $75 million tranche of funding for 
the construction of a facility to store nuclear materials removed 
from the warheads as they are dismantled.  This will essentially 
contribute to the overall design and the early phases of the 
construction of that storage facility.  
	     
	     And finally, a $10-million tranche of money to help 
in the establishment of a monitoring system for the nuclear 
materials as they are withdrawn from the weapons system.  So we 
add that $215-million total to the extant Nunn-Lugar assistance 
which has been flowing -- about $150 million for some overall 
safety improvements for various kinds of equipment and safety 
measures that we have been working out with the Russians over the 
last couple of years.  
	     
	     So this is an area where we will be going a lot more 
work with not only the Russians but with the Ukrainians, Kazhaks, 
and Belarussians.  Belarus, for example, has just, in the last 
couple of weeks, received up to $65 million in FY'93 funds for 
safety, security and dismantlement programs on Belarussian 
territory.  And this was in the wake of their ratification of 
START I, an agreement to accede to NPT. 
	     
	     So we are working very hard with all the parties to 
the Lisbon protocols, and will continue to work very hard with 
them.  And I look upon these three recent agreements with Russia 
as a very important step in that process.
	     
	     Q	  The OPIC funds to -- is that for the field in 
Kazhakstan -- and Conoco already signed this deal with 
Kazhakstan.  Why do you feel now it is necessary -- if it's the 
same one, why do you feel it's necessary?
	     
	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  It's not the same 
deal.  Chevron signed a deal with Kazhakstan, the Tenges oil 
field.  This is a new investment project.  It's a polar lights 
oil development and renovation project, and it's being announced 
today.  So it's completely new.
	     
	     Q	  Can you tell us more about what's involved?
	     
	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Yes.  Conoco, like 
other American oil companies has been searching for ways to do 
two things.  One, to prospect for new oil in Siberia, west 
Siberia; and two, to try to get into the business of renovating 
oil wells and renovating pipelines, both oil and gas, in Russia.  
The objective here, obviously, is to take advantage of the 
natural resources in Russia, increase energy production, which 
will, in turn, increase hard currency revenues, which is what 
Russia needs.
	     
	     So we think this deal is very, very good development 
for Russia.  The Russians do as well, and it's good for an 
American company.  And the American government has played a 
leading role in pulling this together through the credit facility 
in OPIC and through the loan guarantee.
	     
	     Q	  So it's to search and also to renovate fields 
that are already there?
	     
	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  That's right.
	     
	     Q	  On that point, should other American companies 
expect to get administration support for such deals, or should 
they now go to the Ex-Im and try to get the money out of the $2 
billion?
	     
	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, as you know, 
Ex-Im is part of the U.S. government and various parts of the 
U.S. government have been pushing, including the State Department 
and the White House for this deal to be consummated.  And we 
think it will.  And if we arrive at this agreement by April 14th, 
there will be $2 billion in financing available for American 
companies to sell their equipment and sell their services.
	     
	     Q	  That should take up all of the rest of the 
deals and their won't be -- and their will or there won't be 
support for OPIC sort of deals such as this Conoco?
	     
	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  There's a 
tremendous amount of interest on the part of American oil and gas 
companies to invest in Russia.  We think that the Ex-Im oil and 
gas facility, the $2-billion facility, once it is concluded, will 
soak up a lot of that interest.  But I think the interest may 
even extend beyond that.  And if so, the government will respond.
	     
	     Q	  What's the current year budget costs of that 
$2-billion agreement should it go forward?  And is there any 
current year budget costs --
	     
	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I'll have to refer 
you to Ex-Im for that.  I don't know the details of that.
	     
	     Q	  The concessional food sales -- is there any 
current year costs to that, or is it delayed until the years in 
which the payments are due?
	     
	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  The concessional 
food sales are from Food for Progress, which is a USDA program.  
USDA has the funds, we don't need to go back to the Congress to 
expend those funds.  There will be a hit in the budget.  I'd 
refer you to USDA and OMB for the details on that.
	     
	     Q	  Can you talk about the Democracy Corps?
	     
	     Q	     and the private sector -- how many folks are 
going to be involved in that?
	     
	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Why don't I start 
with the Democracy Corps first.  I think the administration felt 
coming into office that there were literally thousands of 
organization, private organizations in the United States that in 
one way or another were working at the goal of trying to achieve 
democratization in Russia, helping on a farmer-to-farmer basis.  
And there were literally 10 or 15 U.S. government agencies that 
had a variety of programs in this area.  And so the 
administration felt -- the President felt it was important to try 
to draw all of these initiatives together under one group to give 
some coherence to the efforts and to give some impetus to the 
efforts.  And so this is a presidential initiative.
	     
	     It will be headed by Ambassador Tom Simons who will 
soon take up his duties as the coordinator for U.S. assistance in 
the former Soviet Union.  And we're very hopeful that we might 
use this Democracy Corps not only to draw upon the resources of 
our own government, but the resources of the American private 
sector and schools and communities across the nation.
	     
	     Q	     any kind of commitment yet, any kind of word 
yet on FY'94, and any new money that needs to be appropriated 
besides the $300 million the President talked about?
	     
	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  The administration 
is requesting additional funds in FY'94 of $700 million.  What 
the President has done this weekend is to consult really 
intensively yesterday with President Yeltsin about additional 
measures the United States could take in some of these areas to 
support reform.  He'll be consulting with the Congress.  When he 
returns to Washington, he'll be consulting also with the other 
ally governments, and we'll make a decision at that time.
	     
	     Q	  Two questions about the $700 billion 
agricultural money.  First of all, I thought it was the sort of 
consensus that what Russia did not need was more loans for food.  
So why did you decide to do it that way?  Secondly, could you 
explain -- agriculture has been stopped from making further loans 
for food because of Russia's inability to pay.  How does this fit 
into that situation?
	     
	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  As you know, the 
United States for a long time has been a major supplier of grains 
and food commodities, agricultural products to Russia.  I think 
between 1991 and '92 we had extended -- a little bit of history 
here -- about $5.5 billion in credits, credit guarantees, through 
the Commodity Credit Corporation.  That was the principal vehicle 
to ensure the sale of American grain products.  On December 1 of 
last year, '92, the Russian government stopped its payments on 
that program.  They are now in arrears to us on that program, and 
therefore, by law, the United States cannot continue that 
program.  And so the President, working with Secretary Espy and 
other officials in the Cabinet, looked for other ways that we 
could promote American grain sales.  
	     
	     And I think we have two ways to do that.  We've 
announced today $194 million in grant food assistance through the 
Food for Progress program.  But we do not have sufficient 
authority to spend $700 million in grant food, and so we looked 
for a concessional loan program.  
	     
	     I think everybody agrees that Russia -- that a 
short-term loan program for Russia would not make sense now, but 
a long-term concessional loan program would.  And that is what 
this program is.  It will provide, once the final details are 
worked out, for a six to seven-year grace period on payments of 
principal.  And then from years seven through 15, which is the 
life of the deal, it will provide for concessional rates of 
interest -- generally around three to four percent.  And so we 
believe and the Russian government believes this is a good deal 
for them because it will avoid the imperative of early payments 
and put them into the out years, but it will also continue this 
very important grain relationship, which is important for them, 
and it's important for the American farm community.
	     
	     Q	  I gather from what you say that this could make 
it explicit -- the Russians' failure to pay the interest on ECC 
loan does not in any way affect this kind of loan going through, 
is that right? 
	     
	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Let me be explicit 
about that.  We are prevented under the law to from continuing  
the Commodity Credit Corporation short-term credit program 
because of Russia's arrearages to the United States.  All of you 
know about those arrearages.  They total about, I think, around 
$640 million.  USDA can give you an exact figure.  So having 
taken that into consideration and wanting to preserve American 
market share and a long-term grain relationship, wanting to 
respond to a specific request from the Russian government for 
major food assistance, knowing that we couldn't take it from the 
grant programs because we don't have sufficient authority there, 
we looked at Food for Progress, which is a program we've used to 
great effect in other parts of the world.  And we consulted with 
the Russian government and arrived at this solution.  
	     
	     I think the Russians are pleased because it provides 
them with the food, but also gives them a little bit of relief on 
the short-term payments.
	     
	     Q	  Where do those funds actually come from?
	     
	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  They come from the 
Food for Progress program, which is a program under USDA's 
authority.  USDA has the authority to spend these funds.  We do 
not need to go back to the Congress for these funds.  And I want 
to make that general point again:  Everything in this package, 
the $1.6 billion package, comprises funds that have already been 
allocated and appropriated by the Congress.  The administration 
can begin to spend these monies tomorrow.  And it's very 
important in our eyes that we expend all the funds this year, 
that we meet these commitments.  And we are confident we'll be 
able to do so.
	     
	     Q	  How did you arrive at the figure of $700 
million -- does that max out that program, or did you actually 
have a range from 0 to --
	     
	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  There's a reason 
for it.  The reason was that the Russian government told us 
that's about the amount of grain that they needed between now and 
harvest time.  And so the idea is that we would begin the 
shipments probably $100 million per month from now until the 
harvest in the autumn, at which time Russia won't require the 
same level of food imports from the West.
	     
	     Q	  I would imagine there's going to be some 
considerable envy and jealousy on the part of some of the other 
republics because of the size and the scope of this with Russia.  
Have you given any consideration to advancing negotiations for 
the same kinds of projects with the Ukraine, with Georgia , with 
some of the other republics?
	     
	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Yes, we're very 
conscience of the fact that we also have an interest in extending 
American support to the 11 other countries of the former Soviet 
Union.  We have told ourselves, and we have planned that in the 
area of technical assistance, the grant technical assistance that 
you see, roughly 50 percent of the funding will go to Russia and 
roughly 50 percent to the other countries. 
	     
	     In the area of food sales, we have been active with 
Ukraine, in grant food assistance with Georgia and Armenia.  We 
will continue that.  And I think it's fair to say that after this 
summit we will go back and look at all of our programs with the 
other countries to ensure that they are adequate and they are 
productive and they're hard-hitting.
	     
	     Q	  Has anything happened at the summit to lead 
American energy companies and other companies to believe that 
Russia is going to be more user-friendly toward them in terms of 
taxing, legalities, bureaucracy?
	     
	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, one of our 
primary objectives coming into this summit was to highlight,  not 
only the economic agenda, but also trade and investment.  And I'd 
like to refer to the point I made at the beginning.  We're 
convinced in talking about this problem -- the problem of how to 
support Russia long-term -- we're convinced that no collection of 
Western governments have the financial resources over the next 
decade to fuel the continuation of reform, that only the private 
sector can do that.  
	     
	     We look at our own society and we see tremendous 
capability in resources in the oil and gas sector.  It is a very 
good match with what the Russians need now, which is financial 
investment in the existing oil and gas wells and pipeline and new 
technology and new capital to finance new production.  
	     
	     That's what the Russian government has told us it 
wants to do, and so that's why we have made such a major emphasis 
on it.  That's why trade and investment was a prominent issue on 
the first day of these talks, and in fact, figured prominently 
last night in the meeting between President Yeltsin and President 
Clinton.  And we're hoping that together we might send a strong 
signal to the American business community that we support their 
efforts to invest in Russia, that the United States, through Ex-
Im and OPEC and the Department of Commerce, will be there to 
support them.
	     
	     Q	  My question is, is Yeltsin in any position to 
deliver on making Russia a more --
	     
	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We think he is.  I 
would note that President Yeltsin's Prime Minister, Mr. 
Chernomyrdin, worked for 30 years in the Russian oil and gas 
sector.  He will now chair a high-level commission with the Vice 
President, Vice President Gore, to try to break through the 
barriers that currently exist to Western investment in the oil 
and gas sector.  We believe we have a commitment to make that 
committee an important committee.  And we're looking forward to 
the work.
	     
	     Q	  What type of mechanism is already in place to 
administer the private sector portion of the program?  And will 
the U.S. be directly involved in the tail end of distribution of 
the actual funds or is the money simply turned over to the 
Russian government for distribution at their will?
	     	    
	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Are you talking 
about the variety of programs listed here?  It depends on the 
program itself.  In most cases, though, we are either working 
through American PBOs or American government agencies to ensure 
that the money obviously is well spent, that the money gets to 
the intended source.  That's an obligation we have to the 
Congress to ensure the money is well spent and that we can 
account for the money.  We have done that in the last couple of 
months intensively and we will continue to do it for each of 
these programs.
	     
	     But they are all quite different.  For instance, in 
the area of grant food and medical assistance, for grant food it 
is carried out through USDA and USDA accounts for the delivery of 
the food.  For grant medical assistance, we've been working 
through Project Hope which is a private organization.  For the 
housing -- for instance, the resettlement of Russian officers, 
we'll be working with a group of American PBOs.  On some of the 
democratization projects, we're working directly with Russian 
private individuals and private foundations.  We're working with 
journalists in Russia on a media project that you may have 
noticed.
	     
	     So we literally have here 30 to 40 different 
activities under all these rubrics and they're all going to be 
carried out in slightly different ways.  Some directly with the 
Russian government, some with Russian citizens.
	     
	     Q	  The Jackson-Vanik restrictions that remain and 
on the COCOM restrictions that remain, can you tell us what the 
President has to do on that?
	     
	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, as George 
noted yesterday, President Yeltsin raised these as irritants in 
the relationship.  The President has noted that.  I think it's 
fair to say we will go back now in our own government when we 
return to Washington and look at both of these questions, and 
we'll get back to the Russian government.
	     
	     Q	  You were not prepared for these questions when 
you got here?
	     
	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We were prepared 
for these questions.  We've looked at them.  But we're not 
prepared to make a quick decision this weekend.  They require --
let me just explain, particularly on Jackson-Vanik.  They require 
consultation with the Congress.  They require consultation with 
the American Jewish community.  And we're very sensitive to those 
concerns.  And so we'll want to go back and talk to them before 
we take any action.
	     
	     Q	  Is this package designed so that you will not 
have to go to Congress for anything at this point?
	     
	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  As I said at the 
beginning, the advantage of this particular package is that all 
the funds have been allocated and appropriated by the Congress.  
So the administration will not have to go back to the Congress to 
seek any additional authority to fund any of these efforts.  In 
effect, they can all begin tomorrow, and I know that many of the 
agencies responsible for these projects will begin tomorrow.  And 
that's the advantage of this particular initiative.
	     
	     Q	  If this, as the President says, is a long-term, 
long-haul thing, and members of Congress are at this moment 
heading for Moscow, why aren't you talking about going to 
Congress and suggesting to the President of Russia that you are 
prepared to go to Congress for various things?
	     
	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think we've been 
clear about that.  The President is discussing this weekend with 
President Yeltsin some additional ideas that we have for American 
funding of additional projects, and ideas that he has.  We have a 
major congressional delegation that left last night, headed by 
Representative Gephardt and we'll want to consult with that 
delegation and other members of Congress before doing anything.  
And we'll also want to consult with our allies.  So that's where 
it stands now.
	     
	     Q	  We've been told repeatedly that a number of 
these items represent different or new ways of spending the money 
already appropriated.  Could you just tick off which of these 
items represents reprogramming or at least spending money in ways 
that it was not previously set to be?
	     
	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think that we've 
said that these are all projects that either Congress had 
allocated money for through the Freedom Support Act; there were 
some funds that were left over from FY'92.  And this 
administration took office and had some new ideas about how the 
funds might be expended.
	     
	     We didn't use just the Freedom Support Act funds or 
the FY'92 funds.  We went into some of the agency allocations --
Ex-Im, OPIC, and USDA -- and tried to look for creative ways to 
further our programs.
	     
	     And example of that is the Food for Progress 
concessional loans.  We had hit a brick wall with another type of 
funding through USDA.  We could not go forward legally, and so we 
looked for a more creative way to ensure continued American 
market share and ensure continued grain sales, and we think we 
found it.
	     
	     Q	  Where, for example, are you getting the money 
for this Russian officer resettlement --
	     
	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  That's from the 
Freedom Support Act funds.
	     
	     Q	  In other words, all of the money is being 
directly spent in new ways, so to speak --
	     
	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Most of the grant 
projects that you see -- if you look at the general chart, the 
second chart, it's broken down into grant and credits.  And if 
you look under grants, the technical cooperation projects that 
total $281.9 million -- that is almost all Freedom Support Act 
funding.  A little bit of it is leftover funds from fiscal year 
'92.  The Nunn-Lugar funds, of course, you know about the 
legislative history of those funds.
	     
	     Q	     cooperation --
	     
	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  From FY '92?  I 
don't have the exact figure.  It was not a considerable figure.
	     
	     Q	  Could you tell us please, has anything happened 
here this weekend that will break the log jam between Ukraine and 
Russia over START -- for START I and II as a result of what's 
happened here --
	     
	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Both presidents, 
President Yeltsin and President Clinton, will be discussing this 
issue this morning.  In fact, we haven't yet gotten to security 
and arms control related issues.  That will be this morning's 
session.  I know that President Clinton will be very strongly 
reinforcing that this is a top priority for us.  We've been 
talking to the Russians and the Ukrainians over the last couple 
of weeks about ways that we might help to facilitate the 
discussions between them.  Up to this point, this has been a very 
important negotiation that's been going on essentially between 
Moscow and Kiev.  And we are at the point now of essentially 
discussing with them if there are ways that we could contribute 
to this discussion, help to move things forward essentially.  
	     
	     But in terms of what is coming out of this weekend, 
I don't yet know.  In a couple hours we'll know.
	     
	     Q?	    Just a follow-up on the financing here.  Is 
any of this robbing Peter to pay Boris -- since it's all current 
year appropriations, have you taken it from anyplace that's been 
earmarked and put it into this fund?
	     
	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  There are smoke and 
mirrors here, and I think it's an important point to note.  We 
could have given you a page of assistance numbers that included 
out-year funding.  We're going to make a long-term commitment to 
many of these projects -- for instance, the enterprise funds, the 
privatization effort, the housing effort.  And we've already 
talked to the Russians about our long-term commitment.  
	     
	     We could have put in really big numbers and this 
could have been a bigger package, but we wanted to make a point:  
This package is FY '93.  It's funds that we have.  And we're 
going to do what we say we're going to do.  And the President 
feels very strongly about that.  In the past there is a legacy 
that the western governments, the combination of governments, put 
up large budget figures and for any number of reasons we're not 
able to meet them, we're determined, and the President is 
determined, to carry out every single program in this package.  
And we'll do it.  
	     
	     But we do have a longer-term commitment, and that's 
part of the discussions on economics this weekend.  We're looking 
for Russian ideas on what it is we can do to most effectively 
support reform.  And we've told them that we do have a commitment 
on some of these programs beyond this fiscal year.
	     
	     Q	     taken it way from any --
	     
	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, we haven't.  
Okay, the question is, have we reprogrammed any of these funds; 
so have we taken it from other countries to pay for programs in 
Russia?  The answer is no, we have not done so.
	     
	     Q	  In terms of funding, there is no available 
monies left -- and you simply find a creative way to find money 
somewhere else.  Doesn't that, in fact, support the -- theory?
	     
	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Not at all.  I 
don't think it does.  That's a particular example, and the 
example is grain sales.  The Commodity Credit Corporation credit 
guarantee program was short-term loans that Russia had to pay 
back within 12 to 15 months.  You all know about Russia's debt 
problem, and Russia was unable to meet those commitments.  So we 
looked for a way to do two things:  to meet Russia's requirement 
for grain.  They're a net grain importer on a massive scale, and 
also meet our objective of making sure that the American farmers 
have a chance to sell their products to Russia.  And we simply 
look for another way to finance that.  And we have legislative 
authority to do it.  This program has been successful in other 
areas.  We had not tried it before in the former Soviet Union, 
but we thought we should now.
	     	  
	     Q	  Isn't this really the Bush-Clinton aid package 
for Russia, since these funds were really first derived by 
initiatives put forward by President Bush?
	     
	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, I don't think 
that's a fair characterization.  A lot of these funds were 
appropriated by the U.S. Congress is 1991, in 1992.  This 
administration took office and inherited some obligations that 
the Bush administration had made.  But we had a long six to seven 
week review of this program.  We decided to meet the commitments 
that had been made by the previous administration.  
	     
	     But we have gone well beyond them in funding the 
enterprise fund, which was just an idea, but the idea had not 
been filled out with a program.  There was no number attached to 
it.  In grouping together some projects and trying to make them 
into a coherent whole in the privatization effort, I would say, 
is another Clinton initiative.  
	     
	     Further, we listened to the Russian government and 
listened to the Russian military who told us that the 
resettlement of their officers was important to them for 
political and economic and social reasons.  And President Clinton 
has responded to that.  And we are making a long-term commitment 
that beyond this demonstration project we're going to figure out 
a way to do much more in trying to settle those officers.  
	     
	     I would also say that the President has given 
impetus to all of us in the agencies to think much more broadly 
about what it is we can do on democratization, because there we 
have some experience and some comparative advantage that lends 
itself to the Russian experience.  And in calling for the 
creation of a democracy corps, which is another new initiative, 
we're hopeful that we can take the resources of the private 
sector as well as the American government, to achieve that 
objective.  
	     
	     So I would not characterize it that way at all.  And 
as most of you know, I am a career civil servant.  I was in the 
last administration.  I'm very familiar with what the last 
administration did.  And I would characterize this as a Clinton 
assistance package for Russia.
	     
	     Q	  There's been a lot of criticism that aid in the 
past has not gotten to the people.  Is there anything in this 
outside of the ombudsman, that will guarantee that this money 
will not just disappear because it's being administered by the 
Russian government?
	     
	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think that -- I 
know that the President and other senior officials of our 
government are concerned that American money be spent wisely and 
that it get to the source that it's intended -- for which it's 
intended.  And so we're going to take great care -- AID and the 
State Department will take great care in making sure that the 
funds are expended properly and that they're reaching their 
source.
	     
	     I would not that this package is not simply a 
package of support solely to the Russian government.  Some of 
these projects, especially in democratization and exchanges, are 
going to be worked out directly with Russian private individuals, 
with businesses.  The private enterprise support is another 
example of that.
	     
	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  If I could just add 
a word on this point with regard to the SSD-related programs, one 
area that we've been looking at very, very closely is 
consideration of actually using Russian firms in subcontracting 
for these kinds of programs.  They would be working very closely, 
of course, with the American firms, who would be the prime 
contractors.  But this is a fine example, I think, of a more --of 
a imaginative and flexible approach toward getting some of that 
funding down to the grassroots level, down to the ground in 
Russia; but at the same time ensuring that it is spent 
efficiently and for the purposes for which it was intended.
	     
	     Q	  When would the democracy corps start?  Exactly 
when do you see this happening?  How would get it off the ground?
	     
	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, the President 
is today calling for the creation of a democracy corps.  I think 
it's fair to say that we're going to work out its framework over 
the next couple of weeks.  Ambassador Simons takes up his duties 
on May 1st.  But in effect we've already started, because over 
the last couple of weeks the administration has begun to reach 
out to people in the private sector who have come to us asking us 
to help facilitate their activities in Russia.  And we've said 
that we will be helpful.  We've also tried to kind of coordinate 
in a much more effective way the activities of our own 
government.  We do have 10 or 15 agencies that are active in 
Russia in one way or another.  We think it makes sense to draw 
them together and to focus their efforts.
	     
	     Q	  Excuse me.  How much of this $1.6 billion will 
actually be spent in the United States by American made goods?
	     
	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I don't have any 
figures for you now, but perhaps we could try to work something 
up in the next couple of days on that.
	     
	     Q	  This figure is larger than the figure that has 
been in the press -- did this program grow yesterday as a result 
of the discussions, or have we just been that far off the mark?
	     
	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, I think --
unfortunately the press has been a little bit off the mark, and 
I'm sorry to say that.  No, this package -- President Clinton put 
us to work about seven weeks ago on this package.  And he was 
briefed intensively on this.  He contributed a lot of the 
intellectual leadership in this package.  He contributed a lot of 
the ideas in the package.  And I think it's fair to say that we 
had this rough package worked out about two weeks ago.  We have 
been refining it ever since.  We spent a couple of days last week 
going over it with the Russian government, both the embassy in 
Washington and the government in Moscow through our own embassy.  
And so it's been evolving.  But this particular package has been 
together for about two weeks.
	     
	     Q	  Where is Yeltsin's input into this then?  There 
was so much talk before about the President wanted to get 
Yeltsin's views about specifically what was needed and so forth.  
Is that in the out years?
	     
	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, it's both.  
President Yeltsin has on several occasions told us, for instance, 
that support for the creation of private businesses is important 
to him; that the resettlement of Russian military officers is 
important; and that first and foremost the effort to privatize 
the state industries is important to them.  
	     
	     And so what we did was to try to make those the 
centerpiece of our technical assistance part o the package.  We 
listened to him.  On the privatization effort, we have been 
working with the Russian government for months on this trying to 
work out all the details.  So the Russian government on most of 
these programs was involved every step of the way.  
	     
	     But let me get at the other part of your question.  
The President is also using this weekend to talk about a broader 
set of initiatives that we might undertake.  And we're looking 
for his ideas.  The President has brought his own ideas to the 
table -- for instance, on energy and the environment and in 
housing.  But we're looking for Russian ideas not.  We need to 
consult with the Congress; and we need to consult with the other 
allied governments that are also active.
	     
	     Q	  There's essentially nothing that happened in 
the last day and a half that measurably altered the package that 
you came in with?
	     
	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  This particular 
package, as I said, was worked out and was ready about two weeks 
ago.  We have since then consulted with the Russian government on 
the final stages of its development, and so this weekend we've 
primarily talked about future, about what more the United States 
and other Western countries can do to support reform in Russia, 
which is our base objective here.
	     
	     Q	  I noticed that you -- that money appropriated 
to train bankers and businessmen and officers.  Can you tell me 
what about job training for workers who are displaced by 
privatization?
	     
	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  You're right; we 
have a program to train Russian -- young Russians in banking and 
financial services in the United States.  Part of the housing 
initiative, it's not just to build housing units, it's to retrain 
Russian officers who are retiring into other professions.
	     
	     Q	     money for job training for workers whose 
jobs are disappearing because of privatization --
	     
	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We have not yet 
allocated any money for that.
	     
	     Q	  Why not?
	     
	     Q	     of the $6 million is going to build 450 
housing units.  Isn't that a lot of money per unit given what the 
Western dollar will buy in the former Soviet Union?
	     
	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  If you want to do 
housing the right way, it's not just the building the framework 
of a house, you've got to think about all the utilities.  You've 
got to think about the purchase of land.  You've got to think 
about sewage and gas and electricity and so forth.  And it's also 
retraining.  It's not enough to put retired -- an officer coming 
out of -- Riga or Tallin or Vilnius in a house in western Russia.  
We think we have an obligation to try to retrain those officers 
as well.  This is responding to a request from the Russian 
government.
	     
	     Q	     of the $6 million will go to retrain --
	     
	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  That's right.
	     
	     Q	  Are you talking about apartment buildings or 
single --
	     
	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We're talking about 
single, individual dwellings.
	     
	     Q	  You're saying that only 450 families will be 
served by this?
	     
	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  What I want to -- I 
thought I pointed out earlier, this is a demonstration project.  
What we didn't want to do -- given the experience that the 
Germans and the Turks and the Italians have had in building 
housing in western Russian, we did not want to leap into it with 
a huge amount of money.  What we want to do is work over the next 
couple of months and try to figure out with American 
organizations in the private sector the best way to get this job 
done.  
	     
	     I noted that we have a long-term commitment to that.  
And so I would expect that we would put a lot more money into 
this in the future .  But we want to do it wisely; we want to 
spend the money wisely.
	     
	     Q	  What is it about this program that convinces 
you that it will protect Russia's reforms and that Russia will be 
in a position to may back the money they're supposed to pay back, 
especially considering their other debt problem?
	     
	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, look, I think 
it's important to note that the United States on its own does not 
have the capability to fuel a continuation of Russian reform.  
It's got to be a collective Western effort, and we're looking to 
our allies to do more as well.  But beyond that, it's really what 
the Russians do that is going to decide the fate of reform.  We 
can simply play a role, and we feel we have an obligation to do 
so, which is consistent with our national interests.
	     
	     Q	  Did the President say that the value of the 
U.S. contribution was that it would create security and 
prosperity for the United States?  So what is it about this 
program that does this?
	     
	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think you have to 
go back to the fundamental objective of our policy toward Russia, 
and that is we want to do everything we can to support the 
continuation of reform.  We are convinced that if reformers stay 
in power, then we'll be able to continue the drawdown of nuclear 
forces, foreign policy cooperation and economic interaction, 
which are the three benefits to the United States from reform in 
Russia.  So it's not a simple question.  You can't just say that 
this program is the answer.  It's a long-term question and we 
have to make a long-term commitment to it.
	     
	     Q	  And then on the question of Russia's ability to 
repay, what convinces you they'll be able to pay seven to 15 
years from now?
	     
	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, the Russian 
government has made a commitment to repay, and what we're hoping 
is that if reform continues, and if they can continue to improve 
their oil and gas sector and earn additional hard currency 
revenues, that Russia will be in a position six or seven years 
from now to pay back those loans.
	     
	     Q	     substantial government-to-government loan 
we've ever gotten into with the Russians?
	     
	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I don't want to 
answer authoritatively on that.  I don't go back 20 or 30 years 
on this.  But in the last four or five years, yes it is, because 
the previous way that we financed grain exports was really to 
just ensure private bank loans.  This is a different type of 
effort.
	     
	     Q	     government loans in any other sector that 
you recall?  I know it wasn't done in --
	     
	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think it's fair 
to say this is a new and unique effort.

Whatever the faults the FBI had, the fact is that responsibility

I believe that the "A-D converters" found on a joystick port are really
timers that tick off how long it takes an R-C circuit (the R being your
paddle) to charge up to something like 1/2 Vcc.  For games this works
pretty well, but you certainly wouldn't want to try to take lab
measurements off something as non-linear as that.

Hmm... I suppose you could linearize it in software, but the real problem
is that the precision of your measurement is no longer constant (higher
voltages would be more precise).

On the other hand, I could be wrong and perhaps the game card designers
splurged for the extra $.50 to make a cheap constant current source out of
an op amp.  But I wouldn't expect that...

These laws written for the Israelites, God's chosen people whom God had
expressly set apart from the rest of the world.  The Israelites were a
direct witness to God's existence.  To disobey God after KNOWing that God
is real would be an outright denial of God and therefore immediately punishable.
Remember, these laws were written for a different time and applied only to 
God's chosen people.  But Jesus has changed all of that.  We are living in the
age of grace.  Sin is no longer immediately punishable by death.  There is
repentance and there is salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ.  And not just
for a few chosen people.  Salvation is available to everyone, Jew and Gentile
alike.

God be with you,

Malcolm Lee  :)

Are you switching high level signals or low level signals like pre-amp
out level signals?  Also, are the clicks you mentioning the big
clack that happens when it switches or are you refering to contact
bounce?  How are you driving the relays?  TTL gate output?  Switching
transistor?  How are the relays connected to what you are driving?

Need more specifics to answer your question!! :-)


I need a small battery powered hi voltage capacitive discharge supply to
deliver ~6 joules at 250 volts. This implies a 200uf cap. I have built
a very satisfactorily operating version from a MAX641, but do not like
the idea of using a $6 single source part. It seems that the ubiquitous
camera flash circuit is what I want, but I cant get mine apart without
breaking it. I would appreciate receiving the circuit description or
a source of one. I have already looked in several electronics circuits
handbooks to no avail. Thanx

Moreover, if two riders are riding together at the same speed,

Allan, I know the circumstances of several of your falls.
On the ride when you fell while I was next behind you,
you made an error of judgement by riding too fast when
you knew the road was damp, and you reacted badly when
you were surprised by an oncoming car.  That crash was
due to factors that were subject to your control.

I won't deny that there's a combination of luck and skill
involved for each of us, but it seems that you're blaming
bad luck for more of your own pain than is warranted.

I'm curious about this statement, is it a known understanding amongst
Christian believers that people who don't understand the Christian
doctrines are enjoying this state? I come from a background with 
a heavy Christian teaching (Lutheran church), and consider myself
knowledgeable with the basic understandings of Christianity. At the 
same time I'm *not* proud of things I don't understand or know of at
this point of time. Ignorance is not bliss!

Re: Waving...

I must say, that the courtesy of a nod or a wave as I meet other bikers while
riding does a lot of good things to my mood... While riding is a lot of fun by
itself, there's something really special about having someone say to you "Hey,
it's a great day for a ride... Isn't it wonderful that we can spend some time
on the road on days like this..." with a gesture.

Was sunny today for the first time in a week, took my bike out for a spin down
to the local salvage yard/bike shop... ran into about 20 other people who were
down there for similar reasons (there's this GREAT stretch of road on the way
down there... no side streets, lotsa leaning bends... ;) ... Went on an
impromptu coffee and bullshit run down to puyallup with a batch of people who 
I didn't know, but who were my kinda people nonetheless.

As a fellow commented to me while I was admiring his bike... "Hey, it's not
what you ride, it's that you ride... As long as it has 2 wheels and an engine
it's the same thing..."

Hell, just save your candle stubs and bring them.  Light them up, and
dribble the wax all over the kindling wood and light _that_.  Although
I like the belly-button lint / eggshell case idea the best, if you're
feeling particularly industrious some eventful evening.  Or you can
do what I did one soggy summer: open the fuel line, drain some onto a 
piece of rough or rotten wood, stick that into the middle of the soon-to-
be inferno and CAREFULLY strike a match... As Kurt Vonnegut titled one
of the latter chapters in Cat's Cradle, "Ah-Whoom!"

Works like a charm every time :-)

Don't you think it would be better to E-mail back to you that we read sci.space

Most people wave or return my wave when I'm on my Harley.
Other Harley riders seldom wave back to me when I'm on my
duck. Squids don't wave, or return waves ever, even to each
other, from what I can tell.

I am looking for information on infra red based position encoders.

The idea would be to bounce the infrared source off a wall and the device would
read out the distance.

preferable it would be rs-232 addressable.



Any leads?

Of course, free trade and slavery don't make much sense together in
a phrase anyway.  Perhaps Mr. Depken meant, "low import tariffs," but
that is quite a bit less than "free trade."

	I am puzzled by the term "concept." Drag free may already have
been flown. It was the idea behind putting up a spacecraft that would
more accurately respond to motions from the Earth's gravity field and
ignore drag. It was proposed many years ago and involved a ball
floating between sensors whose job it was to signal to little
adjustment jets to keep the ball away from them. The ball itself would
then be in a drag free condition and respond only to gravity
anisotropies, whereas the spacecraft itself would be continuously
adjusting its position to compensate for drag.

	Has anyone asked themselves these questions:

	1)  Have you seen the ENTIRE video sequences taken during the
	  opening rounds?  I seem to recall missing several key parts:
		a)  The first five minutes of day one; only the shooting
		  part comes out.
		b)  What happened to the Feds video units?  You mean they do
		  not carry helmet cams?  Wonder why not?
	2)   How is it you can have camera crews with live transmission
	  video present and NOT have an uninterrupted record?

		a)  You realize the units carry ittle bitty 8mm backups?
			That hold 90 minutes per unit?  And there are
			twounits on the professional handhelds (so no

		b)  Until all views are seen, it is premature to point

	25 children dead.  If anyone thinks blaming Koresh -- or the BATF
	helps this any at all, is sick.  and wrong.

		The reason you can tell that the BATF may not be entirely
		straight on this is that the leaders at press conferences
		havew made ANY comments about even the POSSIBILITY that
		Koresh or his followers caused this.

		The BATF agentss are more concerned with their repuations
		and morals ("not my fault, Koresh did it!") than they
		are with:

			25 dead children.

	Same goes for Koresh & his followers - who are all (mostly) dead.

	Six years fighting an unjust COurt issue:  still struggling to be
	patient.

For those who like contrary questions:

	NB:  I was not there.  I am not a Branch Davidian nor a     law
	official hater.  I do hate liars or the six letter variety of same.
	The official side has its advocates already; lets balance the
	equation and asj a few questions on the other side, for the sake
	of an old saw the BATF abd FBI seem to want to bypass:

		innocent until proven guilty.
	not
		innocent until presumed guilty.

	1)  Where are the video tapes from the tanks?  ALL of them.

		Don't tell me they do not exist.  They are standard
		equipment.

	2)  So you think Koresh fired the place, because of the explosion?

		a)  Tear gas comes with an aerosol to spread it.  This
		  aerosol is DELIBERATELY made to be as non-flammable
		  as possible.  It is as non-flammable as possible.

			.... gotcha!

		  ... when in isolation from other substances.

		  WHy was a pipe deliveryu system used rather than remote
		  launchers?  WHy did the FBI not announce "this window,
		  blown in plus tear gas, five minutes; then the wall come
		  down", and maintain a left to right sequence?

		b)  Most aerosols also have a secondary compound, that when
		  mixed in, becomes a VERY flammable (and difficult to trace)
		  suspension, with a VERY special property:  exposure to
		  brief eruptions of high heat (muzzle blasts) or long
		  exposure to low heat (matches, a stove) will NOT tend
		  to ignite.

			What other chemicals come up in the forensics?
			Who else will be allowed to test the site?

		c)  After a few minutes to hours (ifdesired, the combnation
		  rate can be controlled as desired), the mixture can be made
		  to become veryignitable onb exposure to a temperature
		  above a certain point (a tracer round) for a certain
		  heat quantity (a small explosive charge) or for a length
		  of time (start a wall fire and wait).

			Check your military records; look at the tapes.
			Why were tanks (large capacity delivey systems),
			tear gas (why not somnorifics?), and now (why
			the hurry. was there still a comm channel open
			to the outside?).

			Do you see any trace of fire coming BACK to the
			compound in the videos?  ALL the videos?  Which ones
			are missing?

	Do I sound paranoid?  Maybe.  Am I? Probably not.
	You trust the FBI and BATF  to render judgement?
		IN advance of a Court?  God help us.
			(For we are surely not helping ourselves).
	You trut the Federal Gevernment to give us a clean slate?

		You are 4.3 trillion (admitted!) down and counting.
		Look again.

	Did it happen that way?  I do not know.  I was not there.
		AND IT SHOULD WAIT FOR A COURT TO DECIDE.
	But will that happen?  89 people will NOT have the chance
		to tell their side as the BATF leader was, on camera.

No one wins.  Except:  more force next time.

	Listen to your hearts, people.

Thanx again Stephen.

Do you consider Neo-Nazis and white supremists to be Christian?  I'd hardly
classify them as Christian.  Do they follow the teachings of Christ?  Love
one another.  Love your neighbour as yourself.  Love your enemies.  Is Jesus
Christ their Lord and Saviour?  By the persecution of Jews, they are violating
all the precepts of what Christ died for.  They are in direct violation of
the teachings of Christ.  Even Jesus who was crucified by the Jewish leaders
of that time, loved His enemies by asking the Father for forgiveness of their
sins.  I am a Christian and I bear no animosity towards Jews or any one else.
The enemy is Satan, not our fellow man.

God be with you,

Malcolm Lee  :)

Same thing to me.  Everyday the same dog would chase my bicycle.
The owners thought it was cute.  Even after I got the moto,
the stupid dog would do the same thing.  Then one day, I was
coming home in the opposite lane...the fluff with teeth ran to
get me and played momentum sharing with a 73 Dodge pick.

Sounds like it is an SMD interface to me, not being at work now
to actually count pins.  there are two varients, SMD  and
SMDC (I think), only minor differences between them.  Widely used
prior to the advent of SCSI for large drives (or all drives) on minis
(and mainframes(?) no experience on those).

You are probably referring to the products of

		805 499-0335

The make some amazing IRLED's.  The really high-powered devices are arrays of
3, 6, or 9, LED's on a TO-66 header.  The 9-chip model puts out 6.5 Watts in
response to a 5 Amp, 10 uS. pulse at a .5% duty cycle.  I think  these are
designed as illuminators for IR vision systems.

I would also be interested in the application here.  I work with a Dance and

wide stage from 50 feet away.

I will clarify my earlier quote.  God's laws were originally written for 
the Israelites.  Jesus changed that fact by now making the Law applicable to
all people, not just the Jews.  Gentiles could be part of the kingdom of
Heaven through the saving grace of God.  I never said that the Law was made
obsolete by Jesus.

If anything, He clarified the Law such as in that quote you made.  In the
following verses, Jesus takes several portions of the Law and expounds upon
the Law giving clearer meaning to what God intended.  If you'll notice, He
also reams into the Pharisees for mucking up the Law with their own contrived
interpretations.  They knew every letter of the Law and followed it with their
heads but not their hearts.  That is why He points out that our righteousness
must surpass that of the Pharisees in order to be accepted into the kingdom
of Heaven.  People such as the Pharisees are those who really go out of their
way to debate about the number of angels that can dance on the head of a pin.
They had become legalistic, rule-makers - religious lawyers who practiced the
letter of the Law but never really believed in it.  

I think you will agree with me that there are in today's world, a lot of
modern-day Pharisees who know the bible from end to end but do not believe
in it.  What good is head knowledge if there is nothing in the heart?

Christianity is not just a set of rules; it's a lifestyle that changes one's
perspectives and personal conduct.  And it demands obedience to God's will.
Some people can live by it, but many others cannot or will not.  That is their
choice and I have to respect it because God respects it too.

God be with you,

Malcolm Lee  :)

Okay,  let me try to explain this.

When one votes for such a creature as a Senator or,  worse yet,  a President,
one votes not for specific policies but for a general package which must cover
all issues for 4 or 6 years.  As such,  one's influence is highly diluted.
I might add that,  even if one were free to vote on individual regulations,
the vast amount of time required for considering a particular regulation,
combined with the very small chance of one's vote making a difference,  would
make it unreasonable to expect the voter to make an intelligent decision
with respect to specific regulations.

I'm not sure what you mean by "feasible" in this case.  Do you mean that

2 of the four you saw fit to  mention,  and education of minors is always
another possibility,  since minors are generally considered not to be

:(It is an interesting aside that as committed as libertarians claim to

You say this as if it were surprising,  yet in fact a necessary consequence
of libertarian philosophy.  All non-coersive functions should be dealt 
with privately,  therefore it follows that the only functions remaining to
the state are the coersive ones.

so absurd a lie as to be unworthy of consideration.  Do you seriously

You'd need to launch HLVs to send up large amounts of stuff *if* you assume
no new launcher development.  If you assume new launcher development, with
lower costs as a specific objective, then you probably don't want to
build something HLV-sized anyway.

Nobody who is interested in launching things cheaply will buy Titans.  It
doesn't take many Titan pricetags to pay for a laser launcher or a large
gas gun or a development program for a Big Dumb Booster, all of which
would have far better cost-effectiveness.

  Can you beat this ticket?  Personally, I think it's your Duty As a Citizen
to make it as much trouble as possible for them, so maybe they'll Give Up
and Leave Us Alone Someday Soon.
  The cop was certainly within his legal rights to nail you by guessing
your speed.  Mr. Brown (the author of Fight Your Ticket) mentions an
Oakland judge who convicted a speeder "on the officer's testimony that
the driver's car sounded like it was being driven at an excessive speed."
  You can pay off the State and your insurance company, or you can
take it to court and be creative.  Personally, I've never won that way
or seen anyone win, but the judge always listens politely.  And I haven't
seen _that_ many attempts.
  You could try the argument that since bikes are shorter than the
cars whose speed the nice officer is accustomed to guessing, they therefore
appear to be further away, and so their speed appears to be greater than
it actually is.  I left out a step or two, but you get the idea.  If you
can make it convincing, theoretically you're supposed to win.
  I've never tried proving the cop was mistaken.  I did get to see
some other poor biker try it.  He was mixing up various facts like
the maximum acceleration of a (cop) car, and the distance at which
the cop had been pacing him, and end up demonstrating that he couldn't
possibly have been going as fast as the cop had suggested.  He'd
brought diagrams and a calculator.  He was Prepared.  He lost.  Keep
in mind cops do this all the time, and their word is better than yours.
Maybe, though, they don't guess how fast bikes are going all the time.
Besides, this guy didn't speak English very well, and ended up absolutely
confounding the judge, the cop, and everyone else in the room who'd been
recently criminalized by some twit with a gun and a quota.
  Ahem.  OK, I'm better now.  Maybe he'd have won had his presentation
been more polished.  Maybe not.  He did get applause.

Well, if they were Satanists, or followers of an obscure religion,
then I would be sure that Christians would in unison condemn and 
make this to a show case. But when we are dealing with a fanatical
Revelation preacher that kills ultimately everyone, including the
innocent children, then it seems that we are dealing with Christians 
and christians (note the spelling).

Sorry, I should have been more specific.  The 750 SS ran the quater in
12.10 @ 108.17.  The last small V-twin Duc we got in the US (and the 400 is
a Pantah based V-twin) was the 500SL Pantah, and it ran a creditable 13.0 @
103.  Modern carbs and what not should put the 400 in the high 12s at 105.

BTW, FZR 400s ran mid 12s, and the latest crop of Japanese 400s will out
run that.  It's hard to remember, but but a new GOOF2 will clobber an old
KZ1000 handily, both in top end and roll-on.  Technology stands still for

I'm wondering if it's possible to use radio waves to measure the
distance between a transmitter(s) and receiver?

Seems to me that you should be able to measure the signal strength
and determine distance. This would be for short distances (2000 ft),
and I would need to have accuracy of 6 inches, or so.

How about measuring vertical distance as well, any chance - or am I getting
ridiculous?

What frequencies would be best for this? Or does matter?

Sorry if I'm "mucking up" the network with one of those questions best
answered by Bill Willis via US Mail... and I apologize for not being
"tuned-in" to electronics. :-)

What are the consequences of the homophobic ranting of the
self-righteous?  Well, I just noted this on another group,
and thought I'd pass it along.  The context is talk.origins,
and a report of yet another "debate" that was nothing but an
attempt at mindless bullying and factless assertion by a
standard-issue Creationist.  The writer reflects that the
behavior reported reminds him of some Christian groups he has
known.  I believe that the writer is a (non-homosexual) Christian:

+	There is a very effective technique used to promote
+	unit cohesion among the Soldiers of the Lord.  It is
+	called "witnessing"...  I've seen this process used well
+	and poorly; the near devil worship I mention was a group 
+	... that was using the witnessing to get people lathered
+	up to go kill homosexuals or at least terrorize them off 
+	campus as it was clearly God's will that they do so.

I have deleted the specifics of the location, as I do not
believe it characteristic of the place (a state in which I
spent my formative first 10 years), though it *does* have,
unfortunately, a subpopulation that this remark fits to a tee.

No, it's a sign of aristocrtic out-of-touchness with the middle

There are two issues here:  copyright and patent.

The magazine article's contents are copyrighted, and may not be reproduced,
translated, etc., without the copyright holder's permission.  However, this
does not cover the *ideas* expressed, only the form of expression.  Copying
their circuit diagram or PC-board pattern is copyright infringement.  But
it's unlikely that they could stretch copyright far enough to claim that
the circuit design itself is copyrighted.  So long as you draw your own
diagrams and lay out your own boards, copyright shouldn't be an issue.

Patents are different.  The author does *not* have to give you any warning
that the design is covered by patent (although it would be sensible for
him to do so).  In fact, it's possible that *he* was infringing on someone
else's patent without realizing it.  Ignorance of the patented status is
not a defence against infringement, although it might reduce the damages
a court would award.

However... unless there was something seriously novel about the circuit,
almost certainly it is "obvious to one skilled in the art" and therefore
unpatentable.  Routine engineering is not patentable; patents (in theory)
cover only inventions, ideas that are genuinely new.

Caution:  I am not a lawyer.  Consulting a professional would be wise if
significant amounts of money are at stake.

   Not to be too snide about it, but I think this Christianity must
   be a very convenient religion, very maliable and suitable for
   any occassion since it seems one can take it any way one wants
   to go with it and follow whichever bits one pleases and
   reinterpret the bits that don't match with one's desires.  It
   is, in fact, so convenient that, were I capable of believing
   in a god, I might consider going for some brand of Christianity.
   The only difficulty left then, of course, is picking which sect
   to join.  There are just so many.
    
   Dean Kaflowitz

Yes, Christianity is convenient.  Following the teachings of Jesus
Christ and the Ten Commandments is convenient.  Trying to love in a
hateful world is convenient.  Turning the other cheek is convenient.  So
convenient that it is burdensome at times.

Three, actually.  I believe I discussed countersteering a horse
before.

Basically, there are two ways to steer a horse, plow-rein and
neck-rein.  Plow-reining steers him by keeping the reins separate, and
you pull in the direction you wish to go.  Neck-reining steers a horse
by holding the reins together in one hand, and pulling against the
horse's neck in the direction you wish to go.  When training a
plow-steering horse to neck-rein, one technique is to cross the reins
under his necks.  Thus, when neck-reining to the left, the right rein
pulls against the right side of the neck, but the left side of the bit
(which the horse is used to from his plow-reining days).

Are you sorry you asked yet?

This is not news.  In fact it's where I got the idea from, since it was
such a neat item.  Mattell made it, I believe, modeled after a "space 
saber" or "light sword" or something likewise theme-y.  My addition was 
using a motor for continuous display, and polar effects in addition to 
character graphics.  I should have protected it when I had the chance.  
No one to kick but myself...

Ten years ago is about right, since I built mine in '84 or '85.


it seems the 200 miles of trailering in the rain has rusted my bike's headers.
the metal underneath is solid, but i need to sand off the rust coating and

: In my mind, to say that science has its basis in values is a bit of a
: reach. Science has its basis in observable fact. 

I'd say that what one chooses to observe and how the observation is
interpreted and what significance it's given depends a great deal on
the values of the observer. Science is a human activity and as such,
is subject to the same potential for distortion as any other human
activity. The myth that scientists are above moral influence or
ethical concern, that their knowledge can be abstacted whole and pure
from nature untainted by the biases of the scientist, is nonsense.

: If one is to argue for objective values (in a moral sense) then one must
: first start by demonstrating that morality itself is objective. Considering
: the meaning of the word "objective" I doubt that this will ever happen.

: So, back to the original question:

: And objective morality is.....?

This may be an unfortunate choice of words, almost self-contradictory.
Objective in the sense used here means something immutable and
absolute while morality describes the behavior of some group of
people. The first term is all inclusive, the second is specific. The
concept supposedly described may have meaning however. 
If there is a God as described by the Christians (for instance), then
He has existence apart from and independent of humankind; His
existence is outside of our frame of reference (reality). If this
being declares a thing to be so, it is -necessarily- so since He has
defined Himself as omnipotent and, if His claims are to be believed,
He is at least omnipotent relative to us. God is intrinsically
self-defined and all reality is whatever He says it is - in an
objective sense.
If God determines a standard of conduct, that standard is objective.
If human beings are held accountable for their conformance to that
standard while permitted to ignore it, they substitute a relative
morality or mode of conduct, giving the term morality a nebulous,
meaningless sense that can be argued about by those pretending to
misunderstand. The standard is objective and the conduct required to
meet that standard is therefore objectively determined.
Just because it is convenient to pretend that the term morality is
infinitely malleable, doesn't mean that the objective standard itself
doesn't exist. Morality has come to mean little more than a cultural
norm, or the preferred conduct of "decent" people, making it seem
subjective, but it is derived from an absolute, objective, standard.
Ironically, this objective standard is in perfect accord with our true
nature (according to Christianity at least), yet is condemned as being
contrary to human nre, oppressive and severe. This may be due as

much to our amoral inclinations as to the standard itself, but like it
or not, it's there.x

Blue lights. Ultra-violet (by definition?) goes from the blue end of the
spectrum that people see to the radio spectrum (X-rays, cosmic rays etc).

possibly you could get light at the fringe of visibility (which people
with false eye-lenses can see easily, since it's your lenses that soak up
most of the UV), however since most people use UV to get other things
to `glow', and the near-blue is less energetic, it would probably not
work as well, if it worked at all. (lecture on basic atomic physics
fits in here, about electron transitions (quantum leaps) and stuff.

Either the data shows something, or it doesn't. Regardless of what other

Admit it. What you SHOWED to us doesn't prove that gay men are more likely

You're assuming that the low-cost delivery system has to be a separate
project.  But why?  If you are spending hundreds of millions of dollars
in hopes of winning a billion-dollar prize, it is *cheaper* to develop
your own launch system, charging its entire development cost against
your contest entry, than to try to do it with existing launchers.  No
other demand is necessary.

You're assuming that it's going to take a decade to build a new launch
system.  But why?  The Saturn V took less than six years, depending on
exactly when you date its start.  Pegasus took about three from project
start to first flight.  Before SDIO chickened out on orbital development,
the target date for an orbital DC-Y flight was 1996.  If you really want
speed, consider that the first prototypes of the Thor missile (still in
service as the core of the Delta launcher) shipped to the USAF less
than 18 months after the development go-ahead.

One of the most pernicious myths in this whole business is the belief
that you can't build a launcher without taking ten years and spending
billions of dollars.  It isn't true and never was.

			How do I get a DoD number?

If the most Frequently Asked Question in rec.motorcycles is "What is the
DoD?", then the second most Frequently Asked Question must be "How do I
get a DoD number?" That is as simple as asking the Keeper of the List
(KotL, accept no substitue Keepers) for a number. If you're feeling
creative, and your favorite number hasn't been taken already, you can
make a request, subject to KotL approval. (Warning, non-numeric, non-
base-10 number requests are likely to earn a flame from the KotL. Not
that you won't get it, but you _will_ pay for it.)

Oh, and just one little, tiny suggestion. Ask the KotL in e-mail. You'll
just be playing the lightning rod for flames if you post to the whole
net, and you'll look like a clueless newbie too.

By now you're probably asking "So who's the KotL already?". Well, as
John Sloan notes below, that's about the only real "secret" left around
here, but a few (un)subtle hints can be divulged. First, it is not myself,
nor anyone mentioned by name in this posting (maybe :-), though John was
the original KotL. Second, in keeping with the true spirit of Unix, the
KotL's first name is only two letters long, and can be spelled entirely
with hexadecimal characters. (2.5, the KotL shares his name with a line-
oriented text utility.) Third, he has occasionally been seen posting
messages bestowing new DoD numbers (mostly to boneheads with "weenie
mailers"). Fourth, there is reason to suspect the KotL of being a
Dead-Head.

***************** Newsflash: A message from the KotL ******************

Once you have surmounted this intellectual pinnacle and electronically
groveled to the KotL, please keep in mind that the KotL does indeed
work for a living, and occasionally must pacify its boss by getting
something done.  Your request may languish in mailer queue for (gasp!)
days, perhaps even (horrors!) a week or two.  During such times of
economic activity on the part of the KotL's employers, sending yet
another copy of your request will not speed processing of the queue (it
just makes it longer, verification of this phenominon is left as an
excersize for the reader).  If you suspect mailer problems, at least
annotate subsequent requests with an indication that a former request
was submitted, lest you be assigned multiple numbers (what, you think
the KotL *memorizes* the list?!?).

***********************************************************************

One more thing, the KotL says that its telepathic powers aren't what
they used to be. So provide some information for the list, will ya?
The typical DoD List entry contains number, name, state/country, &
e-mail address. For example:

0111:Ed Green:CA:ed.green@East.Sun.COM

(PS: While John mentions below that net access and a bike are the only
requirements for DoD membership, that's not strictly true these days, as
there are a number of Denizens who lack one or both.)

argue with each other and plan rides together.

The difference between this group and your local motorcycle club is that, 
although they get together just about everyday, most have never seen each 
other face to face.  The members of this group live all over the known world 
and communicate with each other electronically via computer.

The computers range from laptops to multi-million dollar computer centers;  
the people range from college and university students to high-tech industry 
professionals to public-access electronic bulletin-board users.  Currently, 
rec.motorcycles (pronounced "wreck-dot-motorcycles," it's the file name for 
the group's primary on-line "meeting place") carries about 2250 articles per 
month;  it is read by an estimated 29,000 people.  Most of the frequent 
posters belong to a motorcycle club, the Denizens of Doom, usually referred 
to as the DoD.

The DoD started when motorcyclist John R. Nickerson wrote a couple of 
parodies designed to poke fun at motorcycle stereotypes.  Fellow computer 
enthusiast Bruce Robinson posted these articles under the pen name, "Denizen 
of Doom."  A while later Chuck Rogers signed off as DoD nr. 0003 Keeper of 
the Flame.  Bruce was then designated DoD nr. 0002, retroactively and, of 
course, Nickerson, the originator of the parodies, was given DoD nr. 0001.

The idea of a motorcycle club with no organization, no meetings and no rules 
appealed to many, so John Sloan -- DoD nr. 0011 -- became Keeper of the 
List, issuing DoD numbers to anyone who wanted one.  To date there have been 
almost 400 memberships issued to people all over the United States and 
Canada, as well as Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, France, 
Germany, Norway and Finland.

Keeper of the List Sloan eventually designed a club patch.  The initial run 
of 300 patches sold out immediately.  The profits from this went to the 
American Motorcycle Heritage Foundation.  Another AMHF fund raiser -- 
selling Denizens of Doom pins to members -- was started by Arnie Skurow a 
few months later.  Again, the project was successful and the profits were 
donated to the foundation.  So far, the Denizens have contributed over $1500 
to the AMA museum.  A plaque in the name of the Denizens of Doom now hangs 
in the Motorcycle Heritage Museum.

As often as possible, the DoD'ers crawl out from behind their CRTs and go 
riding together.  It turns out that the two largest concentrations of 
DoD'ers are centered near Denver/Boulder, Colorado, and in California's 
"Silicon Valley."  Consequently, two major events are the annual Assault on 
Rollins Pass in Colorado, and the Northern versus Southern California 
"Joust."

The Ride-and-Feed is a bike trip over Rollins Pass, followed by a big 
barbecue dinner.  The concept for the Joust is to have riders from Northern 
California ride south; riders from Southern California to ride north, 
meeting at a predesignated site somewhere in the middle.  An additional plan 
for 1991 is to hold an official Denizens of Doom homecoming in conjunction 
with the AMA heritage homecoming in Columbus, Ohio, in July.

Though it's a safe bet the the Denizens of Doom and their collective 
communications hub, rec.motorcycles, will not replace the more traditional 
motorcycle organizations, for those who prowl the electronic pathways in 
search of two-wheeled camaraderie, it's a great way for kindred spirits to 
get together.  Long may they flame.


"Live to Flame -- Flame to Live"	[centerbar]

This official motto of the Denizens of Doom refers to the ease with which 
you can gratuitously insult someone electronically, when you would not do 
anything like that face to face.  These insults are known as "flames";  
issuing them is called "flaming."  Flames often start when a member 
disagrees with something another member has posted over the network.  A 
typical, sophisticated, intelligent form of calm, reasoned rebuttal would be 
something like:  "What an incredibly stupid statement, you Spandex-clad 
poseur!"  This will guarantee that five other people will reply in defense 
of the original poster, describing just what they think of you, your riding 
ability and your cat.

          _The Denizens of Doom: The Saga Unfolds_

                  by John Sloan  DoD #0011

Periodically the question "What is DoD?" is raised. This is one of
those questions in the same class as "Why is the sky blue?", "If there
is a God, why is there so much suffering in the world?" and "Why do
women inevitably tell you that you're such a nice guy just before they
dump you?", the kinds of questions steeped in mysticism, tradition,
and philosophy, questions that have inspired research and discussion
by philosophers in locker rooms, motorcycle service bays, and in the
halls of academe for generations. 

A long, long time ago (in computer time, where anything over a few
minutes is an eternity and the halting problem really is a problem) on
a computer far, far away on the net (topologically speaking; two
machines in the same room in Atlanta might route mail to one another
via a system in Chicago), a chap who wished to remain anonymous (but
who was eventually assigned the DoD membership #1) wrote a satire of
the various personalities and flame wars of rec.motorcycles, and
signed it "The Denizen of Doom". Not wishing to identify himself, he
asked that stalwart individual who would in the fullness of time
become DoD #2 to post it for him. DoD #2, not really giving a whit
about what other people thought and generally being a right thinking
individual, did so.  Flaming and other amusements followed. 

He who would become the holder of DoD membership #3 thought this was
the funniest thing he'd seen in a while (being the sort that is pretty
easily amused), so he claimed membership in the Denizens of Doom
Motorcycle Club, and started signing his postings with his membership
number. 

Perhaps readers of rec.motorcycles were struck with the vision of a
motorcycle club with no dues, no rules, no restrictions as to brand or
make or model or national origin of motorcycle, a club organized
electronically.  It may well be that readers were yearning to become a
part of something that would provide them with a greater identity, a
gestalt personality, something in which the whole was greater than the
sum of its parts.  It could also be that we're all computer nerds who
wear black socks and sneakers and pocket protectors, who just happen
to also love taking risks on machines with awesome power to weight
ratios, social outcasts who saw a clique that would finally be open
minded enough to accept us as members. 

In a clear case of self fulfilling prophesy, The Denizens of Doom
Motorcycle Club was born. A club in which the majority of members have
never met one another face to face (and perhaps like it that way), yet
feel that they know one another pretty well (or well enough given some
of the electronic personalities in the newsgroup). A club organized
and run (in the loosest sense of the word) by volunteers through the
network via electronic news and mail, with a membership/mailing list
(often used to organize group rides amongst members who live in the
same region), a motto, a logo, a series of photo albums circulating
around the country (organized by DoD #9), club patches (organized by
#11), and even an MTV-style music video (produced by #47 and
distributed on VHS by #18)! 

Where will it end? Who knows? Will the DoD start sanctioning races,
placing limits on the memory and clock rate of the on-board engine
management computers? Will the DoD organize poker runs where each
participant collects a hand of hardware and software reference cards?
Will the DoD have a rally in which the attendees demand a terminal
room and at least a 386-sized UNIX system? Only time will tell. 

The DoD has no dues, no rules, and no requirements other than net
access and a love for motorcycles. To become a member, one need only
ask (although we will admit that who you must ask is one of the few
really good club secrets). New members will receive via email a
membership number and the latest copy of the membership list, which
includes name, state, and email address. 

The Denizens of Doom Motorcycle Club will live forever (or at least
until next year when we may decided to change the name). 

                  Live to Flame - Flame to Live

                      The DoD

              by the Denizen of Doom    DoD #1
 
Welcome one and all to the flamingest, most wonderfullest newsgroup of
all time: wreck.mudder-disciples or is it reak.mudder-disciples? The
Names have been changes to protect the Guilty (riders) and Innocent
(the bikes) alike. If you think you recognize a contorted version of
your name, you don't. It's just your guilt complex working against
you. Read 'em and weep. 

We tune in on a conversation between some of our heros. Terrible
Barbarian is extolling the virtues of his Hopalonga Puff-a-cane to
Reverend Muck Mudgers and Stompin Fueling-Injection: 

Terrible: This Hopalonga is the greatest... Beats BMWs dead!! 

Muck: I don't mean to preach, Terrible, but lighten up on the BMW
     crowd eh?  I mean like I like riding my Yuka-yuka Fudgeo-Jammer
     11 but what the heck.  

Stompin: No way, the BMW is it, complete, that's all man.

Terrible: Nahhhh, you're sounding like Heritick Ratatnack! Hey, at
     least he is selling his BMW and uses a Hopalonga Intercorruptor!
     Not as good as a Puff-a-cane, should have been called a
     Woosh-a-stream.

Stompin: You mean Wee-Stream.

Terrible: Waddya going to do? Call in reinforcements???

Stompin: Yehh man. Here comes Arlow Scarecrow and High Tech. Let's see
     what they say, eh? 

Muck: Now men, let's try to be civil about this.

High Tech: Hi, I'm a 9 and the BMW is the greatest.

Arlow: Other than my B.T. I love my BMW!

Terrible: B.T.???

Arlow: Burley Thumpison, the greatest all American ride you can own.

Muck: Ahhh, look, you're making Terrible gag.

Terrible: What does BMW stand for anyway??? 

Muck, Arlow, High: Beats Me, Wilhelm.

Terrible: Actually, my name is Terrible. Hmmm, I don't know either.

Muck: Say, here comes Chunky Bear.

Chunky: Hey, Hey, Hey! Smarter than your average bear!

Terrible: Hey, didn't you drop your BMW???

Chunky: All right eh, a little BooBoo, but I left him behind. I mean 
     even Villy Ogle flamed me for that! 

Muck: It's okay, we all makes mistakes.

Out of the blue the West coasters arrive, led by Tread Orange with
Dill Snorkssy, Heritick Ratatnack, Buck Garnish, Snob Rasseller and
the perenial favorite: Hooter Boobin Brush! 

Heritick: Heya Terrible, how's yer front to back bias?

Terrible: Not bad, sold yer BMW?

Heritick: Nahhh.

Hooter: Hoot, Hoot.

Buck: Nice tree Hooter, how'd ya get up there?

Hooter: Carbujectors from Hell!!!

Muck: What's a carbujector?

Hooter: Well, it ain't made of alumican!!! Made by Tilloslert!!

Muck: Ahh, come on down, we aren't going to flame ya, honest!!

Dill: Well, where do we race?

Snob: You know, Chunky, we know about about your drop and well, don't
     ride! 

Muck: No! No! Quiet!

Tread: BMW's are the greatest in my supreme level headed opinion.
     They even have luggage made by Sourkraut!

High: My 9 too!

Terrible, Heritick, Dill, Buck: Nahhhhh!!!

Stompin, Tread, High, Chunky, Snob: Yesss Yessssss!!!

Before this issue could be resolved the Hopalonga crew called up more
cohorts from the local area including Polyanna Stirrup and the
infamous Booster Robiksen on his Cavortin! 

Polyanna: Well, men, the real bikers use stirrups on their bikes like
     I use on my Hopalonga Evening-Bird Special. Helpful for getting
     it up on the ole ventral stand!  

Terrible: Hopalonga's are great like Polyanna says and Yuka-Yuka's and
     Sumarikis and Kersnapis are good too! 

Booster: I hate Cavortin.

All: WE KNOW, WE KNOW.

Booster: I love Cavortin.

All: WE KNOW WE KNOW.

Muck: Well, what about Mucho Guzlers and Lepurras?

Snob, Tread: Nawwwwww.

Muck: What about a Tridump?

Terrible: Isn't that a chewing gum?

Muck: Auggggg, Waddda about a Pluck-a-kity?

Heritick: Heyya Muck, you tryin' to call up the demon rider himself?

Muck: No, no. There is more to Mudder-Disciples than arguing about make.

Two more riders zoom in, in the form of Pill Turret and Phalanx Lifter.
Pill: Out with dorsal stands and ventral stands forever.

Phalanx: Hey, I don't know about that.

And Now even more west coasters pour in.
Road O'Noblin: Hopalonga's are the greatest!

Maulled Beerstein: May you sit on a bikejector!

Suddenly more people arrived from the great dark nurth:
Kite Lanolin: Hey, BMW's are great, men.

Robo-Nickie: I prefer motorcycle to robot transformers, personally.

More riders from the west coast come into the discussion:
Aviator Sourgas: Get a Burley-Thumpison with a belted-rigged frame.

Guess Gasket: Go with a BMW or Burley-Thumpison.

With a roar and a screech the latest mudder-disciple thundered in. It
was none other that Clean Bikata on her Hopalonga CaBammerXorn. 
Clean: Like look, Hopalonga are it but only CaBammerXorns. 

Muck: Why??

Clean: Well, like it's gotta be a 6-banger or nothin.

Muck: But I only have a 4-banger.

Clean: No GOOD!

Chunky: Sob, some of us only have 2-bangers!

Clean: Inferior!

Stompin: Hey, look, here's proof BMW's are better. The Bimmer-Boys
burst into song: (singing) Beemer Babe, Beemer Babe give me a
thrill... 

Road, Terrible, Polyanna, Maulled, Dill etc.: Wadddoes BMW stand for? 

Heritick, Stompin, Snob, Chunky, Tread, Kite, High, Arlow: BEAT'S ME,
     WILHEM! 

Road, Terrible, Polyanna, Maulled, Dill etc.: Oh, don't you mean BMW? 

And so the ensuing argument goes until the skies clouded over and the
thunder roared and the Greatest Mudder-Disciple (G.M.D.) of them all
boomed out.
G.M.D.: Enough of your bickering! You are doomed to riding
     Bigot & Suction powered mini-trikes for your childish actions. 

All: no, No, NO!!! Puhlease.

Does this mean that all of the wreck.mudder-disciples will be riding
mini-trikes?  Are our arguing heros doomed?  Tune in next week for the
next gut wretching episode of "The Yearning and Riderless" with its
ever increasing cast of characters.  Where all technical problems will
be flamed over until well done.  Next week's episode will answer the
question of: "To Helmet or Not to Helmet" will be aired, this is heady
material and viewer discretion is advised.

          Script for the Denizens of Doom Anthem Video

                by Jonathan E. Quist   DoD #94


[Scene:  A sterile engineering office.  A lone figure, whom we'll call
Chuck, stands by a printer output bin, wearing a white CDC lab coat,
with 5 mechanical pencils in a pocket protector.] 

(editor's note: For some reason a great deal of amusement was had at
the First Annual DoD Uni-Coastal Ironhorse Ride & Joust by denizens
referring to each other as "Chuck". I guess you had to be there. I
wasn't.) 

Chuck:  I didn't want to be a Software Systems Analyst,
 cow-towing to the whims of a machine, and saying yessir, nosir,
 may-I-have-another-sir.  My mother made me do it.  I wanted
 to live a man's life,
[Music slowly builds in background]
 riding Nortons and Triumphs through the highest mountain passes
 and the deepest valleys,
 living the life of a Motorcyclist;
 doing donuts and evading the police;
 terrorizing old ladies and raping small children;
 eating small dogs for tea (and large dogs for dinner).  In short,

	I Want to be      A Denizen!

[Chuck rips off his lab coat, revealing black leather jacket (with
fringe), boots, and cap.  Scene simultaneously changes to the top of
an obviously assaulted Rollins Pass.  A small throng of Hell's Angels
sit on their Harleys in the near background, gunning their engines,
showering lookers-on with nails as they turn donuts, and leaking oil
on the tarmac.  Chuck is standing in front of a heavily chromed Fat
Boy.] 

Chuck [Sings to the tune of "The Lumberjack Song"]:

I'm a Denizen and I'm okay,
I flame all night and I ride all day.

[Hell's Angels Echo Chorus, surprisingly heavy on tenors]:
He's a Denizen and he's okay,
He flames all night and he rides all day.

I ride my bike;
I eat my lunch;
I go to the lavat'ry.
On Wednesdays I ride Skyline,
Running children down with glee.

[Chorus]:
He rides his bike;
He eats his lunch;
He goes to the lavat'ry.
On Wednesdays he rides Skyline,
Running children down with glee.

[Chorus refrain]:
'Cause He's a Denizen...

I ride real fast,
My name is Chuck,
It somehow seems to fit.
I over-rate the worst bad f*ck,
But like a real good sh*t.

Oh, I'm a Denizen and I'm okay!
I flame all night and I ride all day.

[Chorus refrain]:
Oh, He's a Denizen...

I wear high heels
And bright pink shorts,
 full leathers and a bra.
I wish I rode a Harley,
 just like my dear mama.

[Chorus refrain]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

                    Why you have to be killed.

Well, the first thing you have to understand (just in case you managed
to read this far, and still not figure it out) is that the DoD started
as a joke. And in the words of one Denizen, it intends to remain one.

Sometime in the far distant past, a hapless newbie asked: "What does DoD
stand for? It's not the Department of Defense is it?" Naturally, a
Denizen who had watched the movie "Top Gun" a few times too many rose
to the occasion and replied:

"That's classified, we could tell you, but then we'd have to kill you."

And the rest is history.

A variation on the "security" theme is to supply disinformation about
what DoD stands for. Notable contributions (and contributers, where
known) include:

Daughters of Democracy (DoD 23)		Doers of Donuts
Dancers of Despair (DoD 9)		Debasers of Daughters
Dickweeds of Denver			Driveway of Death
Debauchers of Donuts			Dumpers of Dirtbikes

Note that this is not a comprehensive list, as variations appear to be
limited only by the contents of one's imagination or dictionary file.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

                     The rec.moto.photo archive

First a bit of history, this all started with Ilana Stern and Chuck
Rogers organizing a rec.motorcycles photo album. Many copies were made,
and several sets were sent on tours around the world, only to vanish in
unknown locations. Then Bruce Tanner decided that it would be appropriate
for an electronic medium to have an electronic photo album. Bruce has not
only provided the disk space and ftp & e-mail access, but he has taken
the time to scan most of the photos that are available from the archive.

Not only can you see what all these folks look like, you can also gawk
at their motorcycles. A few non-photo files are available from the
server too, they include the DoD membership list, the DoD Yellow Pages,
the general rec.motorcycles FAQ, and this FAQ posting.

Here are a couple of excerpts from from messages Bruce posted about how
to use the archive.

**********************************************************

Via ftp:

cerritos.edu [130.150.200.21]

Via e-mail:

The address is server@cerritos.edu.  The commands are given in the body of the
message.  The current commands are DIR and SEND, given one per line.  The
arguments to the commands are VMS style file specifications.  For
rec.moto.photo the file spec is [DOD]file.  For example, you can send:

dir [dod]
send [dod]bruce_tanner.gif
send [dod]dodframe.ps

and you'll get back 5 mail messages; a directory listing, 3 uuencoded parts
of bruce_tanner.gif, and the dodframe.ps file in ASCII.

Oh, wildcards (*) are allowed, but a maximum of 20 mail messages (rounded up to
the next whole file) are send.  A 'send [dod]*.gif' would send 150 files of
50K each; not a good idea.

**********************************************************

A couple of comments: Bruce has put quite a bit of effort into this, so
why not drop him a note if you find the rec.moto.photo archive useful?
Second, since Bruce has provided the server as a favor, it would be kind
of you to access it after normal working hours (California time). 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

                      Patches? What patches?

You may have heard mention of various DoD trinkets such as patches &
pins. And your reaction was probably: "I want!", or "That's sick!", or
perhaps "That's sick! I want!"

Well, there's some good news and some bad news. The good news is that
there's been an amazing variety of DoD-labeled widgets created. The bad
news is that there isn't anywhere you can buy any of them. This isn't
because of any "exclusivity" attempt, but simply because there is no
"DoD store" that keeps a stock. All of the creations have been done by
individual Denizens out of their own pockets. The typical procedure is
someone says "I'm thinking of having a DoD frammitz made, they'll cost
$xx.xx, with $xx.xx going to the AMA museum. Anyone want one?" Then
orders are taken, and a batch of frammitzes large enough to cover the
pre-paid orders is produced (and quickly consumed). So if you want a
DoD doodad, act quickly the next time somebody decides to do one. Or
produce one yourself if you see a void that needs filling, after all
this is anarchy in action.

Here's a possibly incomplete list of known DoD merchandise (and
perpetrators). Patches (DoD#11), pins (DoD#99), stickers (DoD#99),
motorcycle license plate frames (DoD#216), t-shirts (DoD#99), polo shirts
(DoD#122), Zippo lighters (DoD#99) [LtF FtL], belt buckles (DoD#99), and
patches (DoD#99) [a second batch was done (and rapidly consumed) by
popular demand].

All "profits" have been donated to the American Motorcyclist Association
Motorcycle Heritage Museum. As of June 1992, over $5500 dollars has been
contributed to the museum fund by the DoD. If you visit the museum,
you'll see a large plaque on the Founders' Wall in the name of "Denizens
of Doom, USENET, The World", complete with a DoD pin.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here's a letter from the AMA to the DoD regarding our contributions.

~Newsgroups: rec.motorcycles
~From: Arnie Skurow <arnie@magnus.acs.ohio-state.edu>
~Subject: A letter from the Motorcycle Heritage Museum
~Date: Mon, 13 Apr 1992 11:04:58 GMT

I received the following letter from Jim Rogers, director of the Museum,
the other day.

"Dear Arnie and all members of the Denizens of Doom:

Congratulations and expressions of gratitude are in order for you and the
Denizens of Doom!  With your recent donation, the total amount donated is
now $5,500.  On behalf of the AMHF, please extend my heartfeld gratitude
to all the membership of the Denizens.  The club's new plaque is presently
being prepared.  Of course, everyone is invited to come to the museum to 
see the plaque that will be installed in our Founders Foyer.  By the way,
I will personally mount a Denizens club pin on the plaque.  Again, thank 
you for all your support, which means so much to the foundation, the
museum, and the fulfillment of its goals.

                                Sincerely,


                                Jim Rogers, D.O.D. #0395
                                Director

P.S.  Please post on your computer bulletin board."

As you all know, even though the letter was addressed to me personally,
it was meant for all of you who purchased DoD goodies that made this
amount possible.

Arnie

(Loki Jorgenson loki@Physics.McGill.CA) has provided an archive site
for motorcycle and accessory reviews, here's an excerpt from his
periodic announcement.

**********************************************************

	The Rec.Motorcycles.Reviews Archives (and World Famous Llama
  Emporium) contains a Veritable Plethora (tm) of bike (and accessories)
  reviews, written by rec.moto readers based on their own experiences.
  These invaluable gems of opinion (highly valued for their potential to
  reduce noise on the list) can be accessed via anonymous FTP, Email
  server or by personal request:

  Anonymous FTP:		ftp.physics.mcgill.ca (132.206.9.13)
					under ~ftp/pub/DoD
  Email archive server:		rm-reviews@ftp.physics.mcgill.ca
  Review submissions/questions:	rm-reviews@physics.mcgill.ca

  NOTE: There is a difference in the addresses for review submission
      and using the Email archive server (ie. an "ftp.").

  To get started with the Email server, send an Email message with a line
  containing only "send help".  

  NOTE: If your return address appears like
	domain!subdomain!host!username
      in your mail header, include a line like (or something similar)
	path username@host.subdomain.domain 

	If you are interested in submitting a review of a bike that you
  already own(ed), PLEASE DO!  There is a template of the format that the
  reviews are kept in (more or less) available at the archive site .

            Updated stats & rec.motorcycles rides info

Some of the info cited above in various places tends to be a moving
target. Rather than trying to catch every occurence, I'm just sticking
the latest info down here.

Estimated rec.motorcycles readership: 35K  [news.groups]
 
Approximate DoD Membership: 975  [KotL]

DoD contributions to the American Motorcyclist Association Motorcycle
Heritage Museum. Over $5500  [Arnie]
 
                        Organized (?) Rides:

Summer 1992 saw more organized rides, with the Joust in its third
year, and the Ride & Feed going strong, but without the Rollins Pass
trip due to the collapse of a tunnel.  The East Coast Denizens got
together for the Right Coast Ride (RCR), with bikers from as far north
as NH, and as far south as FL meeting in the Blueridge Mountains of
North Carolina.  The Pacific Northwest crew organized  the first Great
Pacific Northwest Dryside Gather (GPNDG), another successful excuse for
riding motorcycles, and seeing the faces behind the names we all have
come to know so well.  [Thanks to Ed Green for the above addition.]

Also worth mentioning are: The first rec.moto.dirt ride, held in the
Moab/Canyonlands area of southern Utah. Riders from 5 states showed up,
riding everything from monster BMWs to itty-bitty XRs to almost-legal
2-strokes.  And though it's not an "official" (as if anything could be
official with this crowd) rec.moto event, the vintage motorcycle races
in Steamboat Springs, Colorado always provides a good excuse for netters
to gather.  There's also been the occasional Labor Day gather in Utah.
European Denizens have staged some gathers too.  (Your ad here,
reasonable rates!)

When the Lunar Society's $500M estimate of the cost of a lunar colony was
mentioned at Making Orbit, somebody asked Jerry Pournelle "have you talked
to Bill Gates?".  The answer:  "Yes.  He says that if he were going to
sink that much money into it, he'd want to run it -- and he doesn't have
the time."

(Somebody then asked him about Perot.  Answer:  "Having Ross Perot on your
board may be a bigger problem than not having the money.")

Everbody has been defining envelope.
Why was the world "envelope" chosen, rather than say "shell", 
or "boundary".  In analogy with the envelopes of airships perhaps?

Actually, "shell" might be good.  Push the shell too hard and
it (the aircraft?) breaks.

I just mailed this:

I noticed a 2-3in long cut in the tread of the rear tire on my VFR.
The cut is only about as deep as the tread block, and looks like it
only scratched the rubber at the base, but the weird thing is, it's
way over on the edge where I haven't scuffed the tire in yet.
My questions are:
1. How dangerous is this, should I replace the tire right away?
and
2. If I should, since the cut is on the unscuffed portion and the
tire only has about 330 mi on it, what do you think my chances of
getting it replaced under warranty are?

To the nedod mailing list, and Jack Tavares suggested I check out
how old the tire is as one tactic for getting it replaced.  Does
anyone have the file on how to read the date codes handy?

Thanks,
Dean

    I was wondering if anyone out there in net-land knew of a SIMPLE
way to make a 4-band equalizer (single channel).  I need it to accept
LINE inputs (tape deck, CD player, etc.) and output to the same! So
input impedance should equal output impedance.  Also, since I am driving
a line, I would need 1 volt p-p output.  Final requirement is that I
can either:
	      1. Control it digitally
			OR
	      2. Control it easily, or with few resistors

FINALLY - If anyone knows of any FILTER or EQUALIZER chips, that might
be useful, please let me know. (I have seen a couple of them from NATIONAL,
and MAXIM).  Thanks in advance,

When your helmetted nogin hits an immoveabe object, there are only four things
to dissipate the energy: the immoveable object, the helmet shell, the helmet
liner, the rider's head, the rider's ego (ok, five). Assuming that the helmet/
head assembly takes the same impact, if the shell cracks in one case, then in
the other the liner must be dented, or the head gets jiggled. If it's the
the liner that's dented, the helmet is just as toast as if the shell were
cracked, it won't absorb energy form an impact in that area. If it's the head
that's getting jiggled, maybe the new gear isn't of as high quality after all?

Ryan> Another good place for your helmet is your mirror (!). I kid you not.

This is very bad advice.  Helmets have two major impact absorbing
layers... a hard outer shell and a closed-cell foam impact layer.
Most helmets lose their protective properties because the inner liner
compacts over time, long before the outer shell is damaged or
delaminates from age.  Dr. Hurt tested helmets for many years
following his landmark study and has estimated that a helmet can lose
up to 80% of it's effectiveness from inner liner compression.  I have
a video he produced that discusses this phenomenon in detail.

Puncture compression of the type caused by mirrors, sissy bars, and
other relatively sharp objects is the worst offender.  Even when the
comfort liner is unaffected, dents and holes in the foam can seriously
degrade the effectiveness of a helmet.  If you are in the habit of
"parking your lid" on the mirrors, I suggest you look under the
comfort liner at the condition of the foam.  If it is significantly
damaged (or missing :-), replace the helmet.

	I have come to the conclusion that the TV stations here in LA

	In a not so subtle way they are preparing their audience for the

That leaves you between $900 and $1000 (depending on the accuracy

your wish to learn to ride safely, you could get them to pick up
the cost of the MSF course and some of the safety gear. Early

True, but that is exactly the "problem": the Mormon extermination order

individuals like Robert Weiss (who could have been Gov. Boggs' Lieutenant;
he would have fitted right in, drewling et al), and seems a modern-day
occurrence, based on results (slander, persecution, misrepresentation,

In intent and purpose, what really has changed?

What I mean is that secular authorities are to be watched, as we believe
that Satan has been given some power and dominion over the earth to divert
truth, judgment, and justice.  In addition, we believe that the adversary
has power to influence the unjust and idolatrous (greed for money would be
a good example) in order to bring about persecution, war, oppression, and
evil combinations.  As an intelligent being, don't you suppose that the
destroyer would yield his influence foremost on those with political power?

As far as Utah is concerned, what I pointed out were some horrible examples
of environmental nightmares imposed upon by secular authorities, which have
brought death, disease, (i.e. the "downwinders") and environmental contami-
nation.  I am hardly "paranoid," I am just not "expecting" too much from a
secular government that may not share our values and faith, and which indeed
(as Gov. Boggs et al.) may be out to harm and destroy us.  As a matter of
fact, prophecies in my church indicate that in future years, (global)
persecution against Mormons will so increase in intensity and scope, that
(paraphrasing) "all those who wish to escape persecution and murder must
flee to Zion."  Zion (the "pure in heart") will be re-established in those
days, and it AIN'T our current secular authorities who will rule over it...

Come now, at issue is in how much the authorities escalated an otherwise

right into the hands of an apocalyptic-thinking individual (he had prepared

had "some" responsibility to protect their own citizens, even if they were

KS, I see you're wanting Malcolm's response. Allow me one last inter-
jection then please:

Distinguishing among the religious Jews, you've excepted the Messianic
for obvious reasons. Specifically, are you saying it's these religious 
Jews, who trace their lineage back to Abraham by blood and orthodoxy, 
rather than by faith, who won't agree?  Orthodox Jews?  

As to the a/a (if I understand your direction), the issue remains 
unproven I suspect, considering how atheists and agnostics so often 
look to reason. Atheist, it is reasonable to conclude will not agree.
For agnostics, a poll seems in order. Who knows?  Myself, I'm not so 
sure the atheists can be counted out. 

For the orthodox, I wonder how many would follow Moses, or Abraham,
or David in accepting God's Word? Is the particular covenant to which
one adheres, more important than God promisimg? I reckon for many it
depends on the ongoing dialogue. Under these considerations, you might 
understand why I think it's premature to assert who will and won't agree.

MAGI: 

[Sneak Preview: Later still, eschatology and apocalyptics were a fertile meeting
 ground for Iranian and Judeo-Christian religions, as can be seen in the famous
 _Oracles of Hystaspes_, a work whose Iranian roots are undeniable and which
 most likely dates from the beginning of the Christian era, probably the
 second century CE (Widengren, 1968). The Zoroastrian doctrine of the Savior of
 the Future (Saoshyant) was the basis for the story of the coming of the Magi
 to Bethlehem in the _Gospel of Matthew_ (2:1-12).]

  The Old Persian word magu, rendered in Greek by magos, is of uncertain 
etymology. It may originally have meant "member of the tribe," as in the
Avestan compound mogu-tbish ("hostile to a member of the tribe"). This meaning
would have been further resticted, among the Medes, to "member of the priestly
tribe" and perhaps to "priest" (Benveniste, 1938; Boyce, 1982). The term is
probably of Median origin, given that Herodotus mentions the "Magoi" as one of
the six tribes of the Medes.
  For a variety of reasons we can consider the Magi to have been members of a
priestly tribe of Median origin in western Iran. Among the Persians, they were
responsible for liturgical functions, as well as for maintaining their
knowledge of the holy and the occult. Most likely, the supremacy of the Median
priesthood in western Iran became established during the time of the Median
monarchy that dominated the Persians from the end of the eighth century
through the first half of the sixth century BCE until the revolt of Cyrus the
Great (550 BCE). The Persians were indebted to the Medes for their political
and civil institutions as well. Even if hypotheses have been advanced
concerning the existence of Magi of Persian origin in the Achaemenid period
(Boyce, 1982), we must still maintain that they were of Median origin. This is
demonstrated by the eposide of the revolt of Gaumata the Magian, mentioned by
Darius I (522-486 BCE) in the inscription at Bisutun (Iran), as well as by
Greek sources. Indeed, Herodotus insists on the idea of the usurpatory power of
the Medes against the Persians through the conspiracy of the Magi.
  The fact that the Magi may have been members of a tribe that handed down the
sacerdotal arts in a hereditary fashion naturally did not exclude the
possibility that some of them undertook secular prefessions. This seems to be
attested by the Elamite tablets at Persepolis.
  There is a theses, put forth by Giuseppe Messina, that denies that the Magi
are members of an ethnic group by suggesting that they are simply members of
the priesthood - a priesthood of purely Zoroastrian origin. This thesis is
untenable; on the other hand, the hypothesis that their name is related to the
Avestan term magavan, derived from the Gathic maga (Vedic, magha, "gift"), is
not without foundation (Mole, 1963). The meaning of maga can probably be found,
in conformity with the Pahlavi tradition, within the context of the concept of
purity, or separation of the "mixture" of the two opposed principles of spirit
and matter. The maga, which has been erroneously interpreted as "chorus," from
the root mangh, which is said to mean "sing the magic song" (Nyberg, 1966) and
has been rendered simply by an expression like unio mystica, seems to be an
ecstatic condition that opens the mind to spiritual vision. In any case, though
there may be a relation between the Old Persian term magu and the Avestan terms
magavan and maga, we must maintain a clear distinction between the Magi and the
Avestan priesthood. The Avesta ignores the Median or Old Persian term, despite
a recent hypothesis proposed by H.W. Bailey; Old Persian inscriptions ignore
the Avestan term for "priest," athravan (Vedic, athravan), even if this is 
perhaps present in an Achaeminid setting in the Elamite tablets of Persepolis 
(Gershevitch, 1964).
  The term magu has been present in Zoroastrianism throughout its history; the
Pahlavi terms mogh-mard and mobad represent its continuation. The latter in
particular derives from an older form, magupati ("head of the Magi"). During
the Sasanid period (third to seventh centuries CE), which saw the formation of
a hierarchically organized church, the title mobadan mobad ("the high priest of
high priests") came to be used to designate the summit of the ecclesiastical
hierarchy.
  The Magi practiced consanguineous marriage, or khvaetvadatha (Av.; Pahl.,
khwedodah). They also performed a characteristic funeral rite: the exposure of
the corpse to animals and vultures to remove the flesh and thereby cleanse it.
The corpse was not supposed to decompose, lest it be contaminated by the demons
of putrefaction. This practice later became typical of the entire Zoroastrian
community and led to the rise of a complex funeral ritual in Iran and among the
Parsis in India. Stone towers, known as dakhmas, were built especially for this
rite. During the time of Herodotus the practice of exposure of the corpse was
in vogue only among the Magi; the Persians generally sprinkled the corpse with
wax, then buried it. The practice was widespread, however, among the peoples
of Central Asia.
  The Magi were the technicians of and experts on worship: it was impossible to
offer sacrifices without the presence of a Magus. During the performance of a
ritual sacrifice, the Magus sang of the theogony (the Magi were possibly the
custodians of a tradition of sacred poetry, but we know nothing about the
relationship of this tradition to the various parts of the Avesta) and was
called upon to interpret dreams and to divine the future. The Magi were also
known for the practice of killing harmful, or "Ahrimanical," animals (khrafstra)
such as snakes and ants. They dressed in the Median style, wearing pants,
tunics, and coats with sleeves. They wore a characteristic head covering of
felt (Gr. tiara) with strips on the sides that could be used to cover the nose
and mouth during rituals to avoid contaminating consecrated objects with their
breath (Boyce, 1982). The color of these caps, in conformity with a tradition
that is probably of Indo-European origin, according to Georges Dumezil, was
that of the priesthood: white.
  In all likelihood, during the Achaemenid period the Magi were not in
possession of a well-defined body of doctrine, and it is probable that they
gradually adopted Zoroastrianism; they were most likely a clergy consisting of
professional priests who were not tied to a rigid orthodoxy but were naturally
inclined to eclecticism and syncretism. Nonetheless, they must have been
jealous guardians of the patrimony of Zorastrian traditions. By virtue of this
they were the educators of the royal princes. The wisest of them was responsible
for teaching the prince the "magic of Zarathushtra, son of Horomazes" and thus
the "cult of the gods." Magi who excelled in other virtues were entrusted with
the education of the prince so that he would learn to be just, courageous, and
master of himself.
  During the Achaemenid period the Magi maintained a position of great
influence, although they were certainly subordinate to the emperor. Despite
several dramatic events such as the massacre they suffered after the death of
Gaumata the Magian - in which, according to Herodotus (who calls himself
Smerdis), the Persians killed a large number of Magi to avenge the usurpation -
the Magi nevertheless managed to maintain their influence at court in Media,
in Persia, and in the various regions of the empire where they were stationed
as a consequence of the Persian civilian and military administration.
  No priesthood of antiquity was more famous than that of the Magi. They were
renowned as followers of Zarathushtra (Zoroaster); as the teachers of some of
the greatest Greek thinkers (Pythagoras, Democritus, Plato); as the wise men
who arrived, guided by a star, at the manger of the newborn savior in
Bethlehem; and as the propagators of a cult of the sun in India. But they were
also known as the Chaldeans, the priesthood of Babylon, known for its occultism;
this was perhaps the reason that the term magos had a pejorative sense in Greek,
like "goes," "expert in the magic arts" (Bidez and Cumont, 1938). Indeed, the
Chaldeans were experts in all types of magical arts, especially astrology, and
had a reputation for wisdom as well as knowledge.
  To understand the reasons for such various and sometimes discordant views, it
is necessary to distinguish between the Magi of Iran proper and the so-called
western Magi, who were later hellenized. In the Achaemenid period both must
have been at least in part Zoroastrian, but the western Magi (those of the
Iranian diaspora in Asia Minor, Syria, Mesopotamia, and Armenia), who came in
contact with diverse religious traditions, must have, sooner or later and in
varying degrees, been influenced by syncretic concepts.
  The Greeks were familiar with both kinds of Magi and, depending on their
varying concerns, would emphasize one or the other aspect of them. Classical
historians and geographers, including Herodotus and Strabo, document their
customs, while the philosophers dwell above all on their doctrines: dualism,
belief in the hereafter, Magian cosmology and cosmogony, and their theology
and eschatology. Those sources most interested in the doctrines of the Magi
even speak of Zarathushtra as a Magus. In doing so they are repeating what the
Magi themselves said from the Median and Achaemenid periods, when they adopted
Zoroastrianism. At that time they embraced Zarathushtra as one of their own and
placed themselves under his venerable name.
  Zoroastrianism had already undergone several profound transformations in the
eastern community by the time of the Acheamenids and was already adapting those
elements of the archaic religion that refused to die. It has been said quite
often, in an attempt to characterize the precise role of the Magi in the
Zoroastrian tradition, that the Vendidad (from vi-daevo-data, "the law-abjuring
daivas"), part of the Avesta, should be attributed to them. (This collection of
texts from various periods is primarily concerned with purificatory rules and
practices.) Nonetheless, the hypothesis is hardly plausible, since the first
chapter of the Vendidad - a list of sixteen lands created by Ahura Mazda, the
supreme god of Zoroastrianism, but contaminated by an attack by Ahriman (Pahl.;
Gathic-Avestan, Angra Mainyu), the other supreme god and the ultimate source of
all evil and suffering - does not mention western Iran, Persia, or Media (the
land of Ragha mentioned in the text cannot be Median Raghiana). Furthermore, it
has been noted (Gershevitch, 1964) that if the authors had been Magi the
absence of any reference to western Iranian institutions, including their own
priesthood, would be very strange.
  The Magi were above all the means by which the Zoroastrian tradition and the
corpus of the Avesta have been transmitted to us, from the second half of the
first millennium BCE on. This has been their principal merit. We can attribute
directly to the Magi the new formulation that Iranian dualism assumed, known to
us especially from Greek sources and, in part, from the Pahlavi literature of
the ninth and tenth centuries CE. According to this formulation, the two poles
of the dualism are no longer, as in the Gathas, Spenta Mainyu ("beneficent
spirit") and Angra Mainyu ("hostile spirit") but Ahura Mazda himself and Angra
Mainyu (Gershevitch, 1964). [See Ahura Mazda and Angra Mainyu.] This trans-
formation was of immense consequence for the historical development of Zoro-
astrianism and was most likely determined by the contact of the Magi with the
Mesopotamian religious world. In this new dualism - which was that later known
to the Greeks (Aristotle, Eudemus of Rhodes, Theopompus, and others) - we can
see the affirmation of a new current of thought within Zoroastrianism, to which
we give the name Zurvanism. [See Zurvanism.]
  Thanks to their adherence to Zoroastrianism, the Magi played an enormously
important role in the transmission of Zarathushtra's treachings, as well as in
the definition of the new forms that these would assume historically. Their
natural propensity to eclecticism and syncretism also helped the diffusion of
Zoroastrian ideas in the communities of the Iranian diaspora. The Greeks began
to study their doctrines and to take an interest in them (Xanthus of Lydia,
Hermodorus, Aristotle, Theopompus, Hermippus, Dinon), even writing treatises
on the Persian religion, of which only the titles and a few fragments have
survived. In the Hellenistic period, the Magi were seen as a secular school of
wisdom, and writings on magic, astrology, and alchemy were lent the authority
of such prestigious names as Zarathushtra, Ostanes, and Hystaspes, forming an
abundant apocryphal literature. (Bidez and Cumont, 1938).
  Later still, eschatology and apocalyptics were a fertile meeting
ground for Iranian and Judeo-Christian religions, as can be seen in the famous
_Oracles of Hystaspes_, a work whose Iranian roots are undeniable and which
most likely dates from the beginning of the Christian era, probably the
second century CE (Widengren, 1968). The Zoroastrian doctrine of the Savior of
the Future (Saoshyant) was the basis for the story of the coming of the Magi
to Bethlehem in the _Gospel of Matthew_ (2:1-12). [See Saoshyant.]
  The Sasanid period saw the Magi once again play a determining role in the
religious history of Iran. Concerned to win back the western Magi (de Menasce,
1956), and eager to consolidate Zoroastrianism as the national religion of
Iran, the priests of Iranian sanctuaries in Media and Persia were able to
establish a true state church, strongly hierarchical and endowed with an
orthodoxy based on the formation of a canon of scriptures. The leading figures
in the development of a state religion and of Zoroastrian orthodoxy were Tosar
and Kerder, the persecutors of Mani in the third century.

SAOSHYANT:
  The Avestan term saoshyant ("future benefactor"; MPers., soshans) designates
the savior of the world, who will arrive at a future time to redeem humankind.
The concept of the future savior is one of the fundamental notions of Zoro-
astrianism, together with that of dualism; it appears as early as in the Gathas.
Zarathushtra (Zoroaster), as the prophet of the religion, is himself a Sao-
shyant, one who performs his works for the Frashokereti, the end of the present
state of the world, when existence will be "rehabilitated" and "made splendid."
[See Frashokereti]
  Later Zoroastrian doctrine developed this notion into a true eschatological
myth and expanded the number of Saoshyants from one to three. All the saviors
are born from the seed of Zarathushtra, which is preserved through the ages in
Lake Kansaoya (identified with present-day Lake Helmand, in Seistan, Iran),
protected by 99,999 fravashis, or guardian spirits. The greatest of the awaited
Saoshyants, the victorious Astvatereta ("he who embodies truth"), the son of
the Vispataurvairi ("she who conquers all"), is the third, who will make
existence splendid; he appears in Yashts 19. Upon his arrival humankind will
no longer be subject to old age, death, or corruption, and will be granted
unlimited power. At that time the dead will be resurrected, and the living will
be immortal and indestructable. Brandishing the weapon with which he kills the
powerful enemies of the world of truth (that is, the world of the spirit, and
of asha), Astvatereta will look upon the whole of corporeal existence and
render it imperishable. He and his comrades will engage in a great battle with
the forces of evil, which will be destroyed.
  The name Astvatereta is clearly the result of theological speculation
(Kellens, 1974), as are those of his two brothers, Ukhshyatereta, "he who makes
truth grow," and Ukhshyatnemah, "he who makes reverence grow"; the names of the
three virgins (Yashts 13) who are impregnated with the seed of Zarathushtra
when they bathe in Lake Kansaoya and give birth to the Saoshyants, are equally
speculative. Each of these Saoshyants will arrive at the beginning of a
millennium, initiating a new age and a new cycle of existence; Astvatereta will
appear in the third and final millennium to save mankind.
  The doctrine of the future savior had already taken shape in the Archaemenid
period (sixth to fourth century BCE). It was not, perhaps the principal element
in the formation of the messianic idea, but it was certainly a determining
factor, one that enjoyed great success in the Hellenistic period beyond the
confines of the Iranian world. A similar concept, that of the future Buddha,
Maitreya, was most likely indebted to it, and Christian messianism can trace
its roots to the same source.

God being unknowable, I can't comment on His motives, but it would be
distressing if He allowed us to misunderstand Him through no fault of 
our own.  For sanity's sake we must assume, if we believe in Him at all,
that His message comes through somehow.  The question is whether it comes 
through immediately to every individual, or is contained in a complex 
canon that must be interpreted by experts in consultation with one another, 
or is transmitted directly through appointed representatives who are free
to interpret, extend and modify the canon.  If God's message is indeed
mediated, the further problem arises as to whether the individual under-
stands the mediated message fully and clearly.  Since the responsibility 
for understanding lies ultimately with the individual, we must assume that 
God in His benevolence guides each individual to the appropriate source 
for that individual, whereof the person may or may not drink.

Your example is complicated in our age by the thin line between morality
and politeness.  You might have said "burp", for burping and swearing carry
about the same stigma today.  If you are talking about "taking the Lord's 
name in vain" as a serious transgression, then this example is more a case of 
hypocrisy than of varying moral codes.
 
If there is an absolute moral code, propositions or laws in that code apply
absolutely and universally, by definition.  Conceivably some moral codes
could be subsets of the universal code, as you say at the outset.  So, for
example, God's code could include, "Thou shalt not create Beings without
a hospitable planet to live on", but this law would be inapplicable to us.
Nevertheless, we would be entitled to suppose that all laws applicable
to us are also applicable to God.
 
But when you begin to ask what laws might appear in God's moral code, you have
a sense of the absurdity of the question.  Does God make laws for Himself to
follow?  Perhaps God is not the sort of being to which the category "morality"
can be sensibly applied.

  Of course; sorry for the misunderstanding.  I was referring to the fact
that far more aeronautical development took place in the '30's.  For much
of the '20's, the super-abundance of Jennies and OX-5 engines held down the
industry.  By 1926, many of the obsolete WWI aircraft had been retired
and Whirlwind had their power/weight ratio and reliability up to the point
where long-distance flights became practical.  It's important to note that
the Atlantic was flown not once but THREE times in 1927:  Lindbergh,
Chamberlin and Levine, and Byrd's _America_.  "When it's time to railroad,
you railroad."

  Not off the top of my head; I'll have to dig out my reference books again.
However, I will say that the most common arrangement in Prince Henry the

merchants to put up the rest.  They profits from the voyage would then be
shared.

  The problem is that the amount of prize money required to inspire a
Moon Base is much larger than any but a handful of individuals or corporations
can even consider putting up.  The Kremer Prizes (human powered aircraft),
Orteig's prize, Lord Northcliffe's prize for crossing the Atlantic (won in
1919 by Alcock and Brown) were MUCH smaller.  The technologies required were
within the reach of individual inventors, and the prize amounts were well
within the reach of a large number of wealthy individuals.  I think that only
a gov't could afford to set up a $1B+ prize for any purpose whatsoever.
  Note that Burt Rutan suggested that NASP could be built most cheaply by
taking out an ad in AvWeek stating that the first company to build a plane
that could take off and fly the profile would be handed $3B, no questions
asked.

The Japanese spacecraft, Hiten, crashed on the Moon last weekend.  For the
past three years it has made several lunar flybys and even did some
aerobraking experiments with Earth's atmosphere.  It was placed in lunar
orbit in February 1992, and I guess it finally ran out of fuel and was
unable to maintain its orbit around the Moon.

I became aware of the claim years ago.  So I decided to check it out, on my
own.  But, then, that was in BN times (Before Net).  So, here are some 
references.  See Robin Lane Fox's _The unauthorized version_, (p.284) where 
Lane Fox writes, "... the one passage which appears to [comment on Jesus' 
career] is agreed to be a Christian addition."

In my Re:Albert Sabin response (C5u7sJ.391@sunfish.usd.edu) to Jim Lippard (21
April 93), I noted that consensus is typically indicated subtly as in Elaine 
Pagel's _The gnostic gospels_ (p.85), to wit:  "A comment *attributed* to
Josephus reports ... [emphasis mine]".  Scholars sometimes do not even mention
the two Josephus entries, another subtlety reflecting consensus.

So far as I can deduce, today's consensus is built on at least three things: 
1) the long passage is way out of context, 2) Origen did not know about the
long passage, and 3) the short and long passages are contradictory. 
I don't know the references wherein the arguments which led to consensus are
orginally developed (does anyone?).

Biblical scholars as I defined them include theologians and historians.  The
former, like the latter, incorporate historical, social, technological and
ideological contexts as well as theology.  So the distinction is blurred.  I 
didn't elaborate on that.  Sorry.  (In turn, historians are compelled to
incorporate theology).

Can't say about the number of copies.  These were, however, BG times (Before 
Gutenburg).  A hundred first editions seems exceedingly high; counting on one 
hand seems more reasonable.  Perhaps those mss. without the long insert (if any,
because anything is possible) have been destroyed.  Such a practice is 
certainly not foreign to religions.  Anyway, all we have are mss. which have 
the two entries.  Lippart (in the message noted above) talks about an Arabic 
ms.  But here the ms. date is critical.

I wouldn't bother with the copy protection, if I were you.  If you program
is any good, the pirates will have stripped the protection and will be
distributing the stripped version is well under a week.

Hardware methods prevent J. Random Loser from using his Copy II PC to pirate 
your software, but doesn't stop anyone who knows a few people with enough 
connections to "real" pirates who _will_ be able to defeat your "check for the 
hole" code.

You may want to price your software (depending on what it is) a tad
higher... a price change from $15 to $25 probably would turn off very few
potentials buyers, and that way you could tolerate more pirates (whose
numbers don't change with the price).

As for the 20% pirating figure... ha, ha.  Of course, a lot of pirates just
have this "thing" about having pirated software, even if they never use it,
so perhaps that really wouldn't count towards 20%.  Even so, 20% is awfully
low.

IF it were'nt for the sin of men, none of this killing would have been 
necesarry, He is KIND and LOVING, but also RIGHTEOUS, 
SIN MUST BE PUNISHED.

Before Jesus, man had to take the sins on himself.
But Jesus died and took it all upon Him, so now we also have a FORGIVING GOD.

If He were not KIND and LOVING, there wouldn't have been any people left.




ON the subject of how many competing RC orders there are, let me point out the

  Background: The Orion spacedrive was a theoretical concept.  It
would be a drive using thermonuclear explosions to drive a spacecraft.
The idea was that you'd detonate devices with somewhere from one to
ten megatons yield behind a "pusher plate" attached to the main
spacecraft.  The shock wave from the explosions would transfer
momentum to the ship.

  Now, in an atmosphere I can see this.  The energy of the explosion
heats the atmosphere, which expands explosively and slams a shock wave
into the pusher plate.  But in a vacuum, only two things I can see are
going to hit the plate: fission/fusion products (barium, krypton,
helium, neutrons, evaporated bomb casing) and electromagnetic
radiation (gammas mostly, some light/heat from irradiated fission
products).

  Would this work?  I can't see the EM radiation impelling very much
momentum (especially given the mass of the pusher plate), and it seems
to me you're going to get more momentum transfer throwing the bombs
out the back of the ship than you get from detonating them once
they're there.

  I must be missing something.  Would someone enlighten me via email?

  Thanks.

I am interfacing some simple circuits that run on 9V to my
cpu board which runs at 5-6V.  The optoisolator is a 4N35.
On the led side, I put the signal I want through a 10k resistor
to the base of a 2N2222.  On the transistor side, I tie my
cpu input line to the collector which has a pull-up resistor
of 47k.

It functions OK, but seems VERY slow.  I can detect pulses
that occur at about 2kHz, but not much faster.  Isn't the
rise/fall time of this device, something like 5uS?  I should
be able to detect my target of 40kHz, but I can't get 16kHz.
This is done using wire-wrap and the wires going to the cpu
and to the test pin are about 8 inches long, but I'm not
doing anything high-speed.

In the Art of Electronics, it mentions tying the base of the
phototransistor to ground through a resistor to improve the
speed.  Is that what I need to do?  How do I calculate the
resistor value?

	Yes, but... the minimization of gates is important in part
because of TIMING considerations.  A TTL gate has the basic structure
of AND/OR/INVERT, and an inversion of a sum of a product is just
exactly ONE gate delay.  The reason to find a minimal sum of products
is that this matches a hardware optimization.

	A positive-OR gate (such as the 9-gate solution uses) has
TWO gate delays (and there's another gate delay in the second term)
so that the second solution, while simpler in logic symbols, can 
be expected to be something less than optimal in the real world.
ECL is similar to TTL, in that it can support an OR/AND
gate with the minimum delay (unlike TTL, you get both true and
inverse outputs for 'free' when using ECL).

	PALs are basically large programmable AND/OR/INVERT
gates (with your choice of internal connections between the
various sections, and perhaps some latches), so a minimum sum
of products ALSO is a way to shoehorn a logic design into 
a few PALs.  It's not comparably easy to design with a minimization
of logic gates, but some software packages claim to allow you to
do so, and will take just about any mess of gates (as a nodelist
with 74xxx series logic ICs) and produce a description of
a logic cell array to do the same job.  Xilinx's XACT software
does this by treating each logic block as a macro, and expanding
it all out, then simplifying.

To answer your irrelevant question, yes a person of color is human,
but I still don't know what you mean by human being and you have
merely begged the question without responding.  By trying to inject
the notion of race into the discussion, you muddy the waters without
adding any insight whatever.  The same parallel question could
be "Is a polydactyl person a human being?"  You still have not
answered what you mean by human being.  Please do so.

You won't answer the question and instead drag in irrelevancies.
If you want a definition of human being that does not depend on
the vagaries of law, but holds solid whatever the law may rule,
provide it for me.

More irrelevancies.  As Larry Margolis pointed out, the law
has made special exceptions in order to include fetuses, but does
not follow your version of human being.  And as he pointed out,
brain death is not a means of determining who has the rights
of the living, but rather who has died.  There is a significant
difference.

What I am wondering now is, has your argument so failed you that
you feel it necessary to drag out irrelevancies and leave the
thread you started?  You got answers to your questions when
you began baiting me, if you recall, after you had made some
ridiculous remarks about Adrienne Regard and, having been corrected,
changed the subject with your remarks about having a discussion
of substance.  If you really wanted a discussion of substance,
why then do you disregard logic and substance in order to toss
silly accussations, e.g. "It really doesn't matter to you..."
If it matters to you, then why not define human being and seek
some substance?  You're not going to convince a logical person
of the rightness of your position unless you apply some logic
and show some meaning to your words.

As others point out, one is sacrificed for the other depending on
which has the better chance at survival.  Again, your analogy
fails.  Not precedence, but possession makes a difference here.
A woman's womb is indisputably her own.  Also, I see you ignore
my statement that you would grant rights to a fetus that would
not be granted a born human being.  Was that due to its inconvenience?

You simply assert things without any support.  Your analogy is
not accurate and your assertions are unsupported.  Try this on
for size.  It is not murder for one Siamese twin to kill
the other in the womb.  There.  We now have equal arguments.
But the idea is illogical.  For one Siamese twin to kill the
other in the womb would likely be to kill itself as well.  The
systems are dependent on each other for life.  I'm still struggling
to see anything analagous here and failing to do so.

Your argument is from Fantasy Island.  Your comparison is a total
failure, as I have demonstrated already, and has no basis in
reality, neither legally nor medically.  And for you to assert
that it is not a perfect comparison because of the impossible,
that of coercion or oppression, is ridiculous.  As I said,
you give the analogy too little credit for failure.  On the one
hand you start this by saying you want to take a real, rather than
a hypothetical, situation, then you fly off into Siamese twins
murdering one another in the womb or coercing or oppressing each
other in the womb when the reality of the situation you describe
in now way matches your version.  As I said before, decisions
are made regarding which twin lives and dies in situations where
they cannot both survive.  And, furthermore, as I have already said,
there is a difference between an equal claim to organs and a claim
that is unequal.  You seem to be asserting that a fetus has a
claim on a woman's womb.  When the fetus is born, what happens to
its claim?  And by what reason do you assert its claim?

You haven't answered the question.  The situations are not analagous.

Again you avoid the question.  Dependence can be transferred, and
it is not as slow as you seem to think.

What happened to that claim to bodily organs where life is at stake?
Why does this parent now have an indisputable right to his or her
kidney when previously the parent did not, by your standards?  What
is different about the two situations?  I see I have to spell this
out for you since the meaning was too subtle for you.  In the one
case you do not recognize a difference between a fetus and a born
child (you ask why a born child cannot be abandoned but a fetus
can), and in this case you recognize a significant difference
between the fetus and born child where the lives of the two are at
stake.  You can't have it both ways.  Action and inaction are
irrelevant to the principle, but you are wrong about the inaction
anyway.  Ask any of the numerous women who post here and have
borne children how inactive their pregnancy was.  To have a
healthy, live child, a woman does more than hang out, eat as
she chooses, plays volleyball like she always did, drinks at
parties with her friends, etc.  She behaves very differently, and
the provision of her resources to a fetus may be no more voluntary
than the beating of her heart, but it is far from inactive.

Superficially a good answer, but it isn't that simple.  An awful lot of the
starvation and poverty in the world is directly caused by the economic
policies of the Western countries, as well as by the diet of the typical
Westerner.  For instance, some third-world countries with terrible
malnutrition problems export all the soya they can produce -- so that it can
be fed to cattle in the US, to make tender juicy steaks and burgers.  They
have to do this to get money to pay the interest on the crippling bank loans
we encouraged them to take out.  Fund-raising for Ethiopia is a truly bizarre
idea; instead, we ought to stop bleeding them for every penny they've got.

Perhaps it's more accurate to say that there's a Western ethic against
Western infanticide.  All the evidence suggests that so long as the children
are dying in the Third World, we couldn't give a shit.  And that goes for the
supposed "Pro-Life" movement, too.  They could save far more lives by
fighting against Third World debt than they will by fighting against
abortion.  Hell, if they're only interested in fetuses, they could save more
of those by fighting for human rights in China.

And besides, Suzanne's answer implies that non-Western countries lack this
ethic against infanticide.  Apart from China, with its policy of mandatory
forced abortion in Tibet, I don't believe this to be the case.

------------------------------
Wrong, if a bunch of faggots from the tenderloin decide to go straight
bashing and they selectively target a heterosexual man and beat the bloody
fuck out of him, they would get charged as well under all the federal laws
that exist about violation of civils rights. The focus of their intent is
his sexual orientation, and so the law applies to them as well. The
national government retains the right to make any laws necessary to
sufficiently deter and punish any crime against someone's civil rights
until that behavior becomes so well punished that nobody even tries it!
The fact is, that at last count, gays were not beating straights for their
sexual orientation. Thus, the law is getting applied only to the straights
who indulge themselves. The federal government or judiciary has the right
to enforce the 14th amendment guarantee of equal protection under law even
if it takes 1000 possible charges against people who would violate them. Go
read your constitutional law. We broke the back of the KKK's harrassment
campaign with the same strategy in the early 1900's. So many went to jail
and for so long that it cut the heart out of the KKK.

----------------------------------------
This "mutation" as you call it, protects your little butt too, if you
happen to be somewhere where you're the wrong "shade" for somebody else's
taste. If it can be shown that the motive for the assault on you was
racially motivated, then the full power of these extra laws that bring more
charges and punishments will come against those who harmed you. The first
use of such laws was well over a hundred years ago, and constitutional
scholars of all conviction recognize that this right reserved to the
federal government is well established and not just some short-lived
peculiarity, too! Go read some constitutional law for awhile. Maybe you'll
get it.

 A cash award is OK. A time limit would be nice. You can't give away

Voyager  has the unusual  luck to be on a stable trajectory out of the
solar system.   All it's doing is collecting  fields  data,  and routinely
squirting it down.  One of the mariners is also in stable
solar orbit,  and still providing similiar  solar data.  

Something  in a planetary orbit,  is subject to much more complex forces.

Comsats, in "stable " geosynch  orbits,  require  almost daily
stationkeeping operations.   

For the occasional  deep space bird,  like PFF  after pluto,  sure
it could be left on  "auto-pilot".  but things like  galileo or
magellan,  i'd suspect they need enough  housekeeping that
even untended they'd  end up unusable after a while.

The better question  should be.

Why not transfer  O&M of all birds to a separate agency with continous funding
to support these kind of ongoing science missions.

and Data analysis.  how much would it cost to collect the data
and let it be analyzed  whenever.  kinda like all that landsat data

As I said, you appear to be the only person saying that all morality
is relative.  Most people I know do hold some absolutes in their
moral system.

I >>personally<< believe that the dignity of the individual and the right
of free will are absolutes.  I recognize that there are some moral
systems around which don't accept this; I reject them as dangerous
and anti-social (nazism, some forms of communism, fundamentalist
xtianity--no, that's not a slam).  But for the most part, almost
every moral system agrees on these two points.

Well, then answer me this:   you seem to be opposed to moral relativism
(as you call it) because it has the capacity to degenerate.  Obviously,
then, you would advocate a nonrelative (absolute) moral system.

Whose absolutist moral system do we choose?  

How do we come to this decision?

What about people who disagree with the chosen moral system?





/(hudson)

Fine.  I can agree with most of what you typed here.  However, just because
morality gets based on something nonrelative does NOT mean that we have to
pick your xtianity as its base.

We can start a morality based on dignity of humans, freedom of choice,
tolerance, etc. and NEVER EVER rely on xtianity for anything.  Just because
someone has a consistent moral system based on true principles does not
mean that they have to involve xtianity in it.  Xtianity certainly does not
have a monopoly on principles of behavior; indeed, fewer religions are
guiltier of violating their own principles

Why all the quote marks, Roy?  I can see that they might be appropriate where
there is a legitimate concern that the words are being distorted by context, 
or that they have been appropriated Newspeak-style, but, reading your comments above,
one might be excused if they assumed that you were claiming that "child abuse",
"forced" sexual activity, and "damage" caused by this is non-existant or
greatly overblown.

"Positive experiences", indeed!

Why don't you compare the rates at which blacks and whites commit crimes?
Blacks commit crimes disproportionately, so in a perfectly fair penal
system, blacks would be disproportionately represented.

(Note: black vs. white crime rates is not a racial thing.  It's probably
an economic thing: poor people are more likely to commit crimes, and blacks
are more likely to be poor.  The way to reduce the proportion of minorities
in prison is to increase the wealth of minorities.)

Also if they don't get it exactly right or your eyes change

The situation in this regard has changed considerably in recent years.
See the discussion of "high-power rocketry" in the rec.models.rockets
frequently-asked-questions list.

This is not hardware you can walk in off the street and buy; you need
proper certification.  That can be had, mostly through Tripoli (the high-
power analog of the NAR), although the NAR is cautiously moving to extend
the upper boundaries of what it considers proper too.

You need special FAA authorization, but provided you aren't doing it under
one of the LAX runway approaches or something stupid like that, it's not
especially hard to arrange.

As with model rocketry, this sort of hardware is reasonably safe if handled
properly.  Proper handling takes more care, and you need a lot more empty
air to fly in, but it's basically just model rocketry scaled up.  As with
model rocketry, the high-power people use factory-built engines, which
eliminates the major safety hazard of do-it-yourself rocketry.

This was an open question.  I assumed that if Mr. Archer is a chronic
liar, someone whould have documented it.   This assumption is based on
how talk.origins regulars have documented numerous cases of Creationist
deceptions (such as Duane Guish and his friends).

No long list of Archer mistakes has yet been given, so this may be just
an isolated incident...

An effort was made to remove the sticker.  It came to pieces, leaving
most of it firmly attached to the window.  It was dark, and around
10:00 pm.  The sticker (before being mangled in an ineffective attempt
to be torn off) warned the car would be towed if not removed.  A
"reasonable person" would arguably have driven the car.  Had an
accident occured, I don't think my friend's attorney would have much
trouble fixing blame on the apartment mangement.

As a practical matter, even without a conviction, the cost and
inconvenience of defending against the suit would be considerable.

As a moral matter, it was a pretty fucking stupid thing to do for so
paltry a violation as parking without an authorization sticker (BTW, it
wasn't "somebody's" spot, it was resident-only, but unassigned,
parking).

2.  On April 9, the EJ-1 (Earth-Jupiter #1) sequence memory load was uplinked
to the spacecraft without incident.  This sequence covers spacecraft activity
from April 12, 1993 to June 14, 1993 and includes a window for the Radio Relay
Antenna (RRA) slew test on April 28, 1993.  The command loss timer was set to
11 days as a part of this sequence memory load.

3.  On April 12 and 15, a NO-OP command was sent to reset the command loss
timer to 264 hours, its planned value during this mission phase.

4.  On April 12, cruise science Memory Readouts (MROs) were performed for the
Extreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV), Dust Detector (DDS), and Magnetometer
(MAG) instruments.  Preliminary analysis indicates the data was received
properly.

5.  On April 12, an Ultra-Stable Oscillator (USO) test was performed to verify
the health status of the USO and to collect gravitational red shift experiment
data; long term trend analysis is continuing.

6.  On April 14, a 40bps modulation index test was performed to determine the
optimal Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) when transmitting at 40bps.  Preliminary
analysis of the data suggests that the present pre-launch selected modulation
index is near the optimal level.

7.  On April 15, cruise science Memory Readouts (MROs) were performed for the
Extreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV) and Magnetometer (MAG) instrument.
Preliminary analysis indicates the data was received properly.

8.  On April 15, a periodic RPM (Retro-Propulsion Module) 10-Newton thruster
flushing maintenance activity was performed; all 12 thrusters were flushed
during the activity.  Thruster performance throughout the activity was nominal.

9.  The AC/DC bus imbalance measurements have not exhibited significant
changes (greater than 25 DN) throughout this period.  The AC measurement reads
19 DN (4.3 volts).  The DC measurement reads 111 DN (12.9 volts).  These
measurements are consistent with the model developed by the AC/DC special
anomaly team.

10. The Spacecraft status as of April 15, 1993, is as follows:

       a)  System Power Margin -  60 watts
       b)  Spin Configuration - Dual-Spin
       c)  Spin Rate/Sensor - 3.15rpm/Star Scanner
       d)  Spacecraft Attitude is approximately 18 degrees
           off-sun (lagging) and 6 degrees off-earth (leading)
       e)  Downlink telemetry rate/antenna- 40bps(coded)/LGA-1
       f)  General Thermal Control - all temperatures within
           acceptable range
       g)  RPM Tank Pressures - all within acceptable range
       h)  Orbiter Science- Instruments powered on are the PWS,
           EUV, UVS, EPD, MAG, HIC, and DDS
       i)  Probe/RRH - powered off, temperatures within
           acceptable range
       j)  CMD Loss Timer Setting - 264 hours
           Time To Initiation - 260 hours


GDS (Ground Data Systems):

1.  Galileo participated in a second DSN (Deep Space Network) acceptance test
for the DSN Telemetry Phase 3 Upgrade on April 13, 1993, using CTA-21
(Compatibility Test Area 21).  The purpose of this test was to verify
the flow of Galileo telemetry data through the new Telemetry Group Controller
(TGC) and the Telemetry Channel Assembly (TCA).  The TGC/TCA is the replacement
for the current Telemetry Processing Assembly (TPA).  Seven different telemetry
rates were run for this test; all ran well on both the MTS (MCCC Telemetry
Subsystem) and the AMMOS MGDS V18.0 GIF with the exception of 10bps.  The
10bps rate had some trouble staying in lock; it appears the TGC/TCA was
not metering the data correctly.  Further comparisons between the MGDS and MTS
data from this test are being conducted. MVT (Mission Verification Test) of
the TGC/TCA system is expected to begin May 16, 1993.


TRAJECTORY

     As of noon Thursday, April 15, 1993, the Galileo Spacecraft trajectory
status was as follows:

	Distance from Earth         152,606,000 km (1.02 AU)
	Distance from Sun           277,519,800 km (1.86 AU)
	Heliocentric Speed          93,400 km per hour
	Distance from Jupiter       543,973,900 km
	Round Trip Light Time       17 minutes, 4 seconds


SPECIAL TOPIC

1.  As of April 15, 1993, a total of 70184 real-time commands have been
transmitted to Galileo since Launch.  Of these, 65076  were initiated in the
sequence design process and 5108 initiated in the real-time command process.
In the past week, 7 real time commands were transmitted: 6 were initiated in
the sequence design process and one initiated in the real time command process.
Major command activities included commands to reacquire celestial reference,
uplink the EJ-1 sequence memory load, and reset the command loss timer.

  Lev 17:11: For the life of the flesh is in the blood, and I have given
  it to you upon the altar to make atonement for your souls; for it is
  the blood that makes atonement for the soul.

The Old Testament was very big on the "eye for an eye" business.  It
makes sense that Leviticus would support physical injury to "repay"
moral wrongdoing.

I know about sanctification.  I've been taught all about it in Sunday
school, catechism class, and theology classes.  But even after all
that, I still can't accept it.  Maybe I'm still not understanding it,
or maybe I'm just understanding it all too well.

From the bottom of my heart I know that the punishment of an innocent
man is wrong.  I've tried repeatedly over the course of several years
to accept it, but I just can't.  If this means that I can't accept the
premise that a god who would allow this is 'perfectly good', then so
be it.

	Yeesh, you WILL be nailing those IRLEDs.  May I suggest getting your
mitts on the Siemens SFH484-2 IRLED?  This unit is designed to take some big
current pulses if you can get your duty cycle down a bit.  It will output
nearly a watt (975 mW) with REAL short duty cycle times.

(nice thing about the SFH484-2 is that it is CHEAP.  I got mine for about
50 cents a piece, even though I had to buy 100 of them....)

	BTW, I have seen IRLEDs with outputs up to 6 watts...honest,
6 WATTS.  I don't have the book here at work so I can't recall the company
name.  The 6 watter ain't cheap, around $108 but if you want some power,
mamamia, that's pretty hot.  They also have a 4 watt, a 2 watt and a
1 watt device in their line, and will sell small quan. to individuals.
If you are interested, I can find the book at home and get the
pertinent info.

	Now, as for the position detector, you might try ELTEC in Florida.
Phone number listed in the 92/93 ETID is 904-253-5328.  They seem like 
nice people.  Their specialty is passive infrared detection devices,
so they might be able to help you out.

	I'm curious about your applications if you don't mind saying.
The device sounds like it could be useful in a lasertag game, although you'd
need to up your carrier signal concept to 58.8 KHz......

	Hmmm. I seem to recall that the attraction of solid state record-

per-unit cost than vacuum-tube systems.

	Mind you, my father was a vacuum-tube fan in the 60s (Switched
to solid-state in the mid-seventies and then abruptly died; no doubt
there's a lesson in that) and his account could have been biased.

I am trying to build a circuit that detects the presence of video (Vs.
a blank screen) by monitoring the R,G, and B outputs of a graphics
card.  It should be able to detect the presence of a single pixel at
65 MHz, which would mean detecting a 15 NS pulse.  It should also be
able to tell the difference between a blank screen (about 300 mv)
and a dim screen (say, around 310 mv).  Oh yes, it also needs to be
cheap.  

My first circuit was a dismal failure.  I used 3 compariators; each
compariator had the + input going to one of the guns, the - input
went to a reference created by a voltage divider(a potentiometer).

The first problem was that the compariator was way too slow.. I
needed to get several pixels in a row before it would fire the
compariators, so I could have a whole screen full of text, but my
circuit would not detect it.   

The second problem is that there was more noise on the reference then
the smallest difference between a blank screen and a dim screen.  In
fact the difference between completely black and completely white is
only 650 mv.  I am wondering if I am going to have to amplify the
video signals to make this work.  

There are faster compariators, but they are expensive, and require 
split supplies.   I would need to replace my .49 quad compariator
with three 1.89 compariators, and create a whole new power supply
circuit.  

At this point, I think what I need is some sort of transistor
circuit.  Transistors are fast and cheap and should do the trick...

Unfortunately, I am way out of my league when It comes to designing
transistor circuits, so I am appealing to the net for help.  Any
ideas, tips, circuits, pointers, references, etc. would be greatly
appreciated.  

Oh yes, I only sample the output of this thing every second or so, so
I don't need a fast response time at all, however, I haven't found a
way to take advantage of that fact.

Thanks a lot for any help anybody might be able to give. Of course,
you will have my undying gratitude.

Yes, that's true, but you have to be clear exactly what is
an uninterpreted observation. It's pretty low level stuff.
'The sun shines' is already a LOT higher level than that. We
can agree that 'I perceive brightness' perhaps.

Huh? What do you mean 'all in the same situation?' Let's take me
and Dennis Kriz as examples. We're in pretty different situations,
but I think we can agree as to whether it's day or night. I don't
think we can agree as to whether or not abortion is morally
acceptable. Yet we are certainly in the same difference of
situations with respect to each other. Looks like weasel-words
to me, Frank.

Mixers have a wide variety of implementations; the Mini-Circuits
part you mention is a doubly-balanced diode mixer, but active ones
(BJT, FET) seem more popular in consumer receivers.  You might
call MCL; they have a nice catalog.

The universal answer for wide-coverage, theory+practice, RF design
is the _ARRL Handbook_, published by the American Radio Relay
League, the radio amateur organization.  Any technical bookstore
can order you one.  The book is superb, with lots of accessible
theory, construction projects, and generally interesting stuff.

You might also check out _Solid State Design for the Radio Amateur_
(I think), by Hayward and <someone>.  This has sharper design
and test information about subsystems like mixers.

My online Bible is on a CD, but I don't own a CD-ROM system for the
time being, so I can't search for the famous cite where Jesus explicitly
states that he didn't want to break existing (Jewish) laws. In other
words technically speaking Christians should use Saturday and not Sunday
as their holy day, if they want to conform to the teachings of Jesus.

similar outcries about NAMBLA's presence in the parades
of New York and Boston.

$50 each!!  Don't bother trying to make one yourself, just shop around a
little.  I've found DOD brand DI boxes for as cheap as $20 each.  You can 
get higher end ones for more, but for PA use for bands, I wouldn't bother.

I've got a Belstaff tankbag on my FJ1100, and it ain't too good. It's
difficult to fix it securely cos of the the tank/fairing/sidepanel layout,
and also with the bars on full lock the bag touches the handlebar switches,

Like most high-volume manufacturers, Adcom has most of its PC boards
assembled off-shore (in their case, mostly in the far east).  Final
assembly _and testing_ are done in East Brunswick.

The products are, and have always been, designed entirely in the US;
by their own staff and by audiophile gurus like Walter Jung.  Adcom
also tends to prefer American and European components over their
Japanese/Far East equivalents.

Off-shore assembly is one reason that Adcom is able to make products
that perform as well as those from people like Audio Research and Van
Alstine (and better than Hafler and Forte'), but at a much lower cost.

Of course, if your musical diet consists mostly of Rock, you might
prefer components from Kenwood or Pioneer...

I do read Av Week and don't remember this.  Could you supply the date

This country is hardly ruined. In fact, it is booming compared to after the
1980 election.

This whole "USA has gone to hell and Reagan/Bush caused it", is not only lame,
pathetic, and old....... it's wrong.

Under Reagan/Bush the economy grew by 1.1 trillion dollars.  This is more than 
the entire economy of Germany, a "kind, gentle" country, in many peoples' 
books.  What a joke.

Searched without luck for a FAQ here.  I need a left 85 Aspencade
mirror and Honda wants $75 for it.  Now if this were another piece
of chrome to replace the black plastic that wings come so liberally
supplied with I might be able to see that silly price, but a mirror
is a piece of SAFETY EQUIPMENT. The fact that Honda clearly places
concern for their profits ahead of concern for my safety is enough
to convince me that this (my third) wing will likely be my last.
In the mean time, anyboby have a non-ripoff source for a mirror?

I don't care who told you this it is not generally true. I see EVERY single
line item on a contract and I have to sign it. There is no such thing as
wrap at this university. I also asked around here. Ther is no wrap at 
Marquette, University of Wisconsin Madison, Utah State, Weber State or
Embry Riddle U. I am not saying that it doees not happen but in every instance
that I have been able to track down it does not. Also the president of our
University who was Provost at University of West Virgina said that it did
not happen there either and that this figure must be included in the overhead
to be a legitimate charge.

No Allen you did not. You merely repeated allegations made by an Employee

better or cheaper at the Other NASA centers  where the work is going on.
Kinda funny isn't it that someone who talks about a problem like this is

Why did the Space News artice point out that it was the congressionally

If it takes four flights a year to resupply the station and you have a cost
of 500 million a flight then you pay 2 billion a year. You stated that your
"friend" at Reston said that with the current station they could resupply it
for a billion a year "if the wrap were gone". This merely points out a 
blatent contridiction in your numbers that understandably you fail to see.

   Well, there already is a sulfate process for TiO2 purification.  The
   chlorine process is cleaner, however, and for that reason is achieving
   dominance in the marketplace.

Darn, caught by the white hot heat of technological progress again...

   Most Ti is used in pigment, btw (as the oxide), where it replaced
   white lead pigment some decades ago.  Very little is reduced to the
   metal.

   Which merely evades the issue of why those lunatics are

I did not evade the issue at all. I clearly stated that

Never had any problem with mine...

Are you *SURE* the nut/bolt you are trying is really a 1/2" hex?  13mm
is just slightly larger...  and a 1/2 wrench won't fit on a GM 13mm
nut (my 91 GMC pickup has several 13mm nuts on it...  really annoying, metric
threads too.  Seems that most of the body is metric, most of the engine is

Actually, the idea, like most good ideas, comes from Jules Verne, not
_The Gods Must Be Crazy._  In one of his lesser known books (I can't
remember which one right now), the protagonists are in a balloon gondola,
travelling over Africa on their way around the world in the balloon, when
one of them drops a fob watch.  They then speculate about the reaction
of the natives to finding such a thing, dropped straight down from heaven.
But the notion is not pursued further than that.

Here's the real problem.  Americans have become so insensitive to the needs
of others and so completely wrapped up in themselves that they cannot see
straight or think clearly enough to make even the slightest and most obvious
moral decisions based on reality.

If a man abandons a woman to care for their child on her own, he is not
considered to be a very respectable or decent man by anyone.  This man has
fled his responsibility, has behaved like a lazy coward, and has turned
away from his responsibility to his wife and child.

However, if a woman decides to kill her unborn child to release her burden,
she is not thought of in the same way.  When the man abandons, the woman
suffers but the child is free to grow up and live a happy and normal life.
When the woman abandons, the child is diced or killed with saline or vacuumed
out, and the man has no choice, and the man sometimes suffers so badly that
he wishes he could trade places with his child.

Ths root of this whole problem is selfishness--the arrogance that says, "My
feelings and desires are supreme and your well being is not worth dung."
And when you come down to it, this is the substance of what hell is made of.
It's the reason a loving God can throw selfish people to the devil and his
demons for all of eternity.  Let any one of us unrepentant into heaven, and
we'll ruin it the first chance we get.

: Now, I don't really know the answer to these questions, but I've got a real
: good guess.
: 

And, it's probably right.

: And I wouldn't call *that* 'benevolent', either.
: 

It is a move in the right direction.  As it is now, we don't see our
responsibility because we kill it and get it out of sight.  The media
backs us completely.  Real responsibility does not sell.  The only
"responsibility" that sells in the marketplace is that which is just
enough to make us "feel responsible" without showing anything that
might show us our own true irresponsibility.  We want to "feel" like
good people, but we want nothing with *being* good people.  Just give
me the freedom to say "I'm good", and the rest of the world can burn.
Rape and kill my children and throw my parents to the places where
poor old folks rot until they're dead.  I'll hate my brother and sister
if I wish and I'll cheat on my wife or husband.  Screw the government,
because it screws me, and don't talk to me about giving to the church
because church people are all a bunch of money grubbing hypocrites.
But, I'm a good person.  At least I admit what I do.  At least I love
myself and we all know that is the greatest love in the world--not that
a man lay down his life for his brother...That sounds too "christian".

At the root, this is the substance of what hell is made of.

We've become a self indulgant, backslidden society no longer responsible
to our children, to our parents, to our families, to our government, or
to our God.  This is the root behind justification of every evil, of every
corruption in government, of every slanderous remark, of every lie, and
of every murder.  Society cannot continue to live like this long.  it will
have to destroy itsself soon, and perhaps in the end, that will be the
biggest blessing this world can hope to see.

Why do people see so much evil in trying to turn this situation around?

Hi,
  
  I'm writing a science fiction script and I'm looking for some
answers to questions regarding the Moon and Earth. My starting point
is an impossible situation.  [I checked with a professor at berkeley
and his response was a VERY helpful "can't happen".] If you enjoy
playing with unusual ideas and are willing answer some questions
please contact me via e-mail (jennise@dgi.com).

  I get extremely annoyed when screen and tele-plays ignore basic
facts about computers that I'm determined to be as scientifically

  Sorry for being vague, but I'd like to protect my idea as much as I
can until I'm ready to sell it (hopefully).

Maybe we should ask the 83,103 people who were laid off this January whether
or not we're in a recession. That was a figure that was reported in the
New York Times. There is no official figure, because the Bureau of Labor
Statistics stopped government tracking of layoffs eight months ago due to
budget cuts.

Jobs?  What the hell have jobs to do with it?  It's another touchy-feely 
program from the new, vapid administration.  The fact is, the major claim
made for "universal" immunization -- that "all children will be immunized" --
has absolutely no validity.  Several states already have U.I. programs, have
had these programs for _years_. The result: on average, their success rates
are no better than the national average.  It seems that the gummint hasn't
yet figured out a way to MAKE parents bring their kids in.  Yet another case
of shameless demagoguery from the "new" Democrats, the "agents of change."

Wait a minute.  You've been claiming for quite a while now that
pedophilia, according to CA state law, is a sexual orientation.  Now
your position is that the law doesn't specifically exclude it?

You know damn well what's going to happen.  Some guy in a NAMBLA
T-shirt's going to apply at a day-care, they're going to turn him down,
he's going to take it to court, and the court's going to rule that
sexual orientation is defined as homosexuality, heterosexuality, or
bisexuality.

Unless and until that court decides that pedophilia is a sexual
orientation, you have no business saying so.

There's no "for purposes of this act, the term 'sexual orientation' will
be defined as" section?  No definitions anywhere?  Did they run this
through the state Congress on an accelerated schedule or something?

Part of what started this was my earlier example of Illinois, USA requiring
anyone doing more than X automobile transfers a year (X = 10, I think)
to become licensed as a used car dealer.  In addition, it requirs anyone
with a used car dealer's license to own at least 10 cars at a time, all the
time. 

Let me continue with this example and try to answer Steve's questions.

Steve, let's say you have the talent and inclination to fix up and resell
cars.  Either you've gotten good enough at it in your spare time to bump
up against these limits, or you would like to do it full-time but these
stupid, arbitrary laws prevent you from starting out small and pulling
yourself up.  So I'm protected from a hungry neighborhood competitor willing
to take a low profit while working extra hard to fulfill my needs, and you're
protected from doing what you want with your life.

Here's what I see libertarianism offering you:

Your money is truly yours; it belongs to you.  You can use it to buy a car.
If you use it to buy a car, it is truly your car; it belongs to you.  You
can use your money to fix up that car.  Since it is your car, you can sell
that car.

Your life is truly yours; it belongs to you.  It matters not if someone
thinks that it's "wrong" for you to buy and sell 10 cars within 12 months
rather than, say, 9 cars.  They may dissaprove, but it is not their life or
their money, it is your life and your money.

My money is truly mine; it belongs to me.  I can use it to buy a car.
Perhaps your car.  Perhaps that 10th car, the one that someone, somewhere
dissaproves of you selling and, presumably, of me buying.

That someone could go to the government and insist that the government make
us stop it.  But the government would be powerless to stop us from doing
what we like with our own property, in the abscence of fraud or agression.
And it would be powerless to stop us from associating with each other.

This does not seem to me to be a utopian dream, but basic human decency
and common sense.  A real grass-roots example of freedom and liberty.
And yes, not having a few people acting as our masters, approving or
rejecting each of our basic transactions with each other, does strike me
as a wonderful way to improve the human condition.

   Thanks awfully,
             Patrick

Because to be any use as a nav point you need to know -exactly- where
it is, which means you either nail it to something that doesn't move
or you watch it all the time.  Neither of which is possible on a
deactivated spacecraft.  Then you have to know exactly how far away
from it you are; this may or may not be possible with the hardware on
board. 

Apart from which, there is absolutely no need for navigation beacons.

I used ethylene glycol as antifreeze rather than methanol as it tastes sweeter.

Which makes it legally unsound.  If I were representing Mr. Teel, 
I'd try a procedural approach if I could find one, or recommend 
he plea-bargain.  He's setting himself up to be in hot water.

HOW NOT TO WRITE A DEED

One case involved the construction of a conveyance to grantees "jointly, as 
tenants in common, with equal rights and interest in said land, and to the 
survivor thereof, in fee simple. . . . To Have and to Hold the same unto the 
said parties hereto, equally, jointly, as tenants in common, with equal rights 
and interest for the period or term of their lives, and to the survivor thereof 
at the death of the other."

The court held that the survivorship provision indicated an intent to create a 
joint tenancy.  Germain v. Delaine, 294 Ala. 443, 318 So.2d 681 (1975).

I think the passage you're looking for is the following.

Matthew 5:17    "Think not that I have come to abolish the law and the 
prophets; I have come not to abolish them but to fulfil them. 
Matthew 5:18   For truly, I say to you, till heaven and earth pass away, 
not an iota, not a dot, will pass from the law until all is accomplished. 
Matthew 5:19   Whoever then relaxes one of the least of these commandments 
and teaches men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but he 
who does them and teaches them shall be called great in the kingdom of 
heaven. 
Matthew 5:20   For I tell you, unless your righteousness exceeds that of 
the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. 

There are several problems with this.  The most serious is that the
Law was regarded by Jews at the time (and now) as binding on Jews, but
not on Gentiles.  There are rules that were binding on all human
beings (the so-called Noachic laws), but they are quite minimal.  The
issue that the Church had to face after Jesus' death was what to do
about Gentiles who wanted to follow Christ.  The decision not to
impose the Law on them didn't say that the Law was abolished.  It
simply acknowledged that fact that it didn't apply to Gentiles.  This
is a simple answer, which I think just about everyone can agree to.
(A discussion of the issue in more or less these terms is recorded
in Acts 15.)

However there's more involved.  In order to get a full picture of the
role of the Law, we have to come to grips with Paul's apparent
rejection of the Law, and how that relates to Jesus' commendation of
the Law.  At least as I read Paul, he says that the Law serves a
purpose that has been in a certain sense superceded.  Again, this
issue isn't one of the abolition of the Law.  In the middle of his
discussion, Paul notes that he might be understood this way, and
assures us that that's not what he intends to say.  Rather, he sees
the Law as primarily being present to convict people of their
sinfulness.  But ultimately it's an impossible standard, and one that
has been superceded by Christ.  Paul's comments are not the world's
clearest here, and not everyone agrees with my reading.  But the
interesting thing to notice is that even this radical position does
not entail an abolition of the Law.  It still remains as an
uncompromising standard, from which not an iota or dot may be removed.
For its purpose of convicting of sin, it's important that it not be
relaxed.  However for Christians, it's not the end -- ultimately we
live in faith, not Law.

While the theoretical categories they use are rather different, in the
end I think Jesus and Paul come to a rather similar conclusion.  The
quoted passage from Mat 5 should be taken in the context of the rest
of the Sermon on the Mount, where Jesus shows us how he interprets the
Law.  The "not an iota or dot" would suggest a rather literal reading,
but in fact that's not Jesus' approach.  Jesus' interpretations
emphasize the intent of the Law, and stay away from the ceremonial
details.  Indeed he is well known for taking a rather free attitude
towards the Sabbath and kosher laws.  Some scholars claim that Mat
5:17-20 needs to be taken in the context of 1st Cent. Jewish
discussions.  Jesus accuses his opponents of caring about giving a
tenth of even the most minor herbs, but neglecting the things that
really matter: justice, mercy and faith, and caring about how cups and
plates are cleaned, but not about the fact that inside the people who
use them are full of extortion and rapacity.  (Mat 23:23-25) This, and
the discussion later in Mat 5, suggest that Jesus has a very specific
view of the Law in mind, and that when he talks about maintaining the
Law in its full strength, he is thinking of these aspects of it.
Paul's conclusion is similar.  While he talks about the Law being
superceded, all of the specific examples he gives involve the
"ceremonial law", such as circumcision and the Sabbath.  He is quite
concerned about maintaining moral standards.

The net result of this is that when Paul talks about the Law being
superceded, and Jesus talks about the Law being maintained, I believe
they are talking about different aspects of the Law.  Paul is
embroiled in arguments about circumcision.  As is natural in letters
responding to specific situations, he's looking at the aspect of the
Law that is currently causing trouble: the Law as specifically Jewish
ceremonies.  He certainly does not intend to abolish divine standards
of conduct.  On the other hand, when Jesus commends the Law, he seems
to be talking the Law in its broadest implications for morals and
human relationships, and deemphasizing those aspects that were later
to give Paul so much trouble.

It's unfortunate that people use the same terms in different ways, but
we should be familiar with that from current conflicts.  Look at the
way terms like "family values" take on special meaning from the
current context.  Imagine some poor historian of the future trying to
figure out why "family values" should be used as a code word for
opposition to homosexuality in one specific period in the U.S.  I
think Law had taken on a similar role in the arguments Paul was
involved in.  Paul was clearly not rejecting all of the Jewish values
that go along with the term "Law", any more than people who concerned
about the "family values" movement are really opposed to family
values.

anyway, here goes:  I was just noticing that some of the current bubblejet

McDonnell Douglas rolls out DC-X

        HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif. -- On a picture-perfect Southern
California day, McDonnell Douglas rolled out its DC-X rocket ship last
Saturday.  The company hopes this single-stage rocket technology
demonstrator will be the first step towards a single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO)
rocket ship.

        The white conical vehicle was scheduled to go to the White Sands
Missile Range in New Mexico this week.  Flight tests will start in
mid-June.

        Although there wasn't a cloud in the noonday sky, the forecast for
SSTO research remains cloudy.  The SDI Organization -- which paid $60
million for the DC-X -- can't itself afford to fund full development of a
follow-on vehicle.  To get the necessary hundreds of millions required for
a sub-orbital DC-XA, SDIO is passing a tin cup among its sister government
agencies.

        SDIO originally funded SSTO research as a way to cut the costs for
orbital deployments of space-based sensors and weapns.  However, recent
changes in SDI's political marching orders and budget cuts have made SSTO
less of a priority.  Today, the agency is more interested in using DC-X as
a step towards a low-cost, reusable sounding rocket.

        SDIO has already done 50 briefings to other government agencies,
said Col.  Simon "Pete" Worden, SDIO's deputy for technology.  But Worden
declined to say how much the agencies would have to pony up for the
program. "I didn't make colonel by telling my contractors how much money I
have available to spend," he quipped at a press conference at McDonnell
Douglas Astronautics headquarters.

        While SDIO has lowered its sights on the program's orbital
objective, agency officials hail the DC-X as an example of the "better,
faster, cheaper" approach to hardware development.  The agency believes
this philosophy can produce breakthroughs that "leapfrog" ahead of
evolutionary technology developments.

        Worden said the DC-X illustrates how a "build a little, test a
little" approach can produce results on time and within budget.  He said
the program -- which went from concept to hardware in around 18 months --
showed how today's engineers could move beyond the "miracles of our
parents' time."

        "The key is management," Worden said. "SDIO had a very light hand
on this project.  We had only one overworked major, Jess Sponable."

        Although the next phase may involve more agencies, Worden said
lean management and a sense of government-industry partnership will be
crucial. "It's essential we do not end up with a large management
structure where the price goes up exponentially."

        SDIO's approach also won praise from two California members of the
House Science, Space and Technology Committee. "This is the direction
we're going to have to go," said Rep.  George Brown, the committee's
Democratic chairman. "Programs that stretch aout 10 to 15 years aren't
sustainable....NASA hasn't learned it yet.  SDIO has."

        Rep.  Dana Rohrbacher, Brown's Republican colleague, went further.
Joking that "a shrimp is a fish designed by a NASA design team,"
Rohrbacher doubted that the program ever would have been completed if it
were left to the civil space agency.

        Rohrbacher, whose Orange County district includes McDonnell
Douglas, also criticized NASA-Air Force work on conventional, multi-staged
rockets as placing new casings around old missile technology. "Let's not
build fancy ammunition with capsules on top.  Let's build a spaceship!"

         Although Rohrbacher praised SDIO's sponsorship, he said the
private sector needs to take the lead in developing SSTO technology.

        McDonnell Douglas, which faces very uncertain prospects with its
C-17 transport and Space Station Freedom programs, were more cautious
about a large private secotro commitment. "On very large ventures,
companies put in seed money," said Charles Ordahl, McDonnell Douglas'
senior vice president for space systems. "You need strong government
investments."

        While the government and industry continue to differ on funding
for the DC-XA, they agree on continuing an incremental approach to
development.  Citing corporate history, they liken the process to Douglas
Aircraft's DC aircraft.  Just as two earlier aircraft paved the way for
the DC-3 transport, a gradual evolution in single-stage rocketry could
eventually lead to an orbital Delta Clipper (DC-1).

        Flight tests this summer at White Sands will "expand the envelope"
of performance, with successive tests increasing speed and altitude.  The
first tests will reach 600 feet and demonstrate hovering, verticle
take-off and landing.  The second series will send the unmanned DC-X up to
5,000 feet.  The third and final series will take the craft up to 20,000
feet.

        Maneuvers will become more complex on third phase.  The final
tests will include a "pitch-over" manever that rotates the vehicle back
into a bottom-down configuration for a soft, four-legged landing.

        The flight test series will be supervised by Charles "Pete"
Conrad, who performed similar maneuvers on the Apollo 12 moon landing.
Now a McDonnell Douglas vice president, Conrad paised the vehicles
aircraft-like approach to operations.  Features include automated
check-out and access panels for easy maintainance.

        If the program moves to the next stage, engine technology will
become a key consideration.  This engine would have more thrust than the
Pratt & Whitney RL10A-5 engines used on the DC-X.  Each motor uses liquid
hydrogen and liquid oxygen propellants to generate up to 14,760 pounds of
thrust

        Based on the engine used in Centaur upper stages, the A-5 model
has a thrust champer designed for sea level operation and three-to-on
throttling capability.  It also is designed for repeat firings and rapid
turnaround.

        Worden said future single-stage rockets could employ
tri-propellant engine technology developed in the former Soviet Union.
The resulting engines could burn a dense hydrocarbon fuel at takeoff and
then switch to liquid hydrogen at higher altitudes.

        The mechanism for the teaming may already be in place.  Pratt has
a technology agreement with NPO Energomash, the design bureau responsible
for the tri-propellant and Energia cryogenic engines.

No matter how "absurd" it is to suggest that a common moral system created by
mankind is absolute, it is not contrary to reason to suggest that a common
moral system created by mankind is sensible. In fact, for the Bible to be of
any use to mankind as a moral code, it must be interpreted by mankind and a
workable moral system created for everyday use.

The Jewish Talmud is the result of centuries of Biblical scholars analysing
every word of the Torah to understand the morality behind it. The Children of
Israel were given a very strict set of Moral, Civil, Judicial and Ceremonial
Laws to follow and yet this was clearly not enough to cover every instance
of moral dilemma in their Society. For a Christian, the situation is no better.

It seems to me that the only code of morality that we have from the Judeo-
Christian God is that which is contained in the Bible (which we can see from
the diverse opinions in the Christian newsgroups is not clear). There may well
be an absolute morality defined by the Judeo-Christian God for mankind to
follow but it seems that we only have a subset simply because the concept was
written down by man.

This leads to the problem of defining morality for our society. If we take the
divine Morality then we have a code of practice which may be interpreted in many
different ways (as an example, consider the immolation of heretics in the
fifteenth century and the interpretation of the Bible which allows a man to do
that to another man under the precept to administer Justice). If we take an
agnostic Morality then we have a code of practice that can be modified to suit
society (with all the danger that this implies). Alternatively, we could take
the basis of the Judeo-Christian morality and interpret/extend this to create
and justify a code of morality which suits the society we live in and enables
the people to live Righteously (as many Christian and Non-Christian philosophers
have done).

Whatever the driving force behind the definition of morality for our society, I
think the important aspect is the result.

Hi,

	Being a Electronic Engineering Student with only Electronic II under
my belt, I find myself *needing* to build a moderate wattage Audio Amp. So, 
I'll throw out a couple of question for the vast knowledge of the 'net'!

	Please Explain how Watts are calculated in Audio Amp circuits. No,
Not P=I*E, Just how it relates to one of the following:

	Ai [Current Gain]
	Av [Voltage Gain]
	Ap [Power Gain]
	or whatever.

I already have a ?wonderful? cheap I.E <$20 schematic for a 20W amp, but
I would like to Cross/improve the circuit. The problem is that the parts
list has IC1 and IC2 as NEC70001AB amplifiers. They look like ?11 pin? 
SIP packages with a heatsink. This schematic was published in a 1991 mag
so it may be non-existant now. Anyway, I tried looking up a replacement in
the latest Digi-key Cat and found it  not listed 8(. The closes I could
figure was a 9 pin SIP as TDA1520BU. Anyone got any Ideas? 

	I thought, hey I can rin a PSPICE simulation using 741 opamp 
models. Yea, great! It worked. But, I guess the 741 wasn't made for High
power amps. As a result, I got a Voltage gain of ~15mV/V. Worse than
I started with 8(... Does anyone have a PSPICE CKT file with cheap yet
good gain? How about some models for some of the chips listed in this 
E-mail? Any ASCII Chip info you guys can send me? 

I'm open to Suggestions/Ideas/Comments/Help!
Please E-mail since I have little time to search the News... 
And I'll post if there's and interest!
John

Also:  How come I don't hear more people talking about the
Federal Reserve Bank?  Just ask yourself these questions:

1) Why would anyone borrow money from themselves at interest?
The Federal government does * NOT * * NOT *
The Federal reserve Bank is private.  The American people are
being ripped off royally.  100% of the income tax goes to pay
on the Federal debt to the Federal Reserve Bankers.  Not one
dime goes for services.  Services like the military and
welfare come from excise taxes and the like.

2) Why do we the American people stand for this?????

I'll say!  Imagine that there were a couple groups up there, maybe landing
a few weeks apart.  The year-mark starts coming on for the first group.
Isn't a billion pretty good incentive to take a shot at a potential
winner?  "Yeah, that's a shame that Team A's life support gave out
so close to the deadline.  Thanks for the billion."

On the other hand, if Apollo cost ~25billion, for a few days or weeks
in space, in 1970 dollars, then won't the reward have to be a lot more
than only 1 billion to get any takers?

Please email me any info.  If I get anything interesting, I'll compile
it and get it on the net.  Thanks.

Yes, and of course the Kinsey Report taken 50 years ago in much more liberal

Or smart enough to realize that that argument would have to apply to every

No, I don't mean the LR, whatever that is.  As for which GD, I'm using _The

The interesting notion is that (I watched TV tonight) Koresh never
claimed officially to be Jesus Christ. His believers hoped that 
he would be, but he never took this standpoint himself.

He was more interested in breaking the seven seals of Revelation,
and make sure that Armageddon would start. Well it did, and 19
children died, and no God saved them.

I've asked your god several times with all my heart to come to me.  I
really wish I could believe in him, 'cos no matter how much confidence
I build up on my own, the universe *is* a big place, and it would be
so nice to know I have someone watching over me in it...

I've gone into this with an open mind.  I've layed my beliefs aside
from time to time when I've had doubt, and I've prayed to see what
good that would do.  I don't see what more I can do to open myself to
your god, short of just deciding to believe for no good reason.  And
if I decide to believe for no good reason, why not believe in some
other god?  Zeus seems like a pretty cool candidate...

All I know is that in all my searching, even though I've set aside my
pride and decided that I want to know the truth no matter how
difficult it may be to accept, I have never had any encounter with any
deity, Christian or otherwise.

Please tell me what more I can do while still remaining true to myself.

countersteering when being taught to instruct.  It doesn't seem to have

Jesus certainly demonstrated the great depth of his love for the

Sorry, but the events today made me even more negative concering
organized religion.

Fishing rights are disputed.  Between 2 nations, no matter *how* 
friendly, there is ALWAYS fishing disputes.

What I was getting at was the 54 40' or fight slogan is OLD STUFF
dealing with the LAND dispute.  No one is saying 54 40' or fight 
about fishing rights.  The territorial dispute about the Oregon
Territory (we called it) is LONG resolved.

Fishing rights...small potatoes.

        Well, lets see....I took a class on this last fall, and I have no
notes so I'll try to wing it...  
        Here's how I understand it. Remember from stellar evolution that 
black holes and neutron stars(pulsars) are formed from high mass stars,
M(star)=1.4M(sun).  High mass stars live fast and burn hard, taking
appoximately 10^5-10^7 years before going nova, or supernova.  In this time,
they don't live long enough to get perturbed out of the galactic plane, so any
of these (if assumed to be the sources of GRB's) will be in the plane of the
galaxy.  
        Then we take the catalog of bursts that have been recieved from the
various satellites around the solar system, (Pioneer Venus has one, either
Pion. 10 or 11, GINGA, and of course BATSE) and we do distribution tests on our
catalog.  These tests all  show, that the bursts have an isotropic
distribution(evenly spread out in a radial direction), and they show signs of
homogeneity, i.e. they do not clump in any one direction.  So, unless we are
sampling the area inside the disk of the galaxy, we are sampling the UNIVERSE.
Not cool, if you want to figure out what the hell caused these things.  Now, I
suppose you are saying, "Well, we stil only may be sampling from inside the
disk."  Well, not necessarily.  Remember, we have what is more or less an
interplanetary network of burst detectors with a baseline that goes waaaay out
to beyond Pluto(pioneer 11), so we should be able, with all of our detectors de
tect some sort of difference in angle from satellite to satellite.  Here's an 
analogy:  You see a plane overhead.  You measure the angle of the plane from
the origin of your arbitrary coordinate system.  One of your friends a mile
away sees the same plane, and measures the angle from the zero point of his
arbitrary system, which is the same as yours.  The two angles are different,
and you should be able to triangulate the position of your burst, and maybe
find a source.  To my knowledge, no one has been able to do this.  
        I should throw in why halo, and corona models don't work, also.  As I
said before, looking at the possible astrophysics of the bursts, (short
timescales, high energy) black holes, and pulsars exhibit much of this type of
behavior.  If this is the case, as I said before, these stars seem to be bound
to the disk of the galaxy, especially the most energetic of the these sources.
When you look at a simulated model, where the bursts are confined to the disk,
but you sample out to large distances, say 750 mpc, you should definitely see
not only an anisotropy towards you in all direction, but a clumping of sources 
in the direction of the  galactic center.  As I said before, there is none of
these characteristics.  
        
        I think that's all of it...if someone needs clarification, or knows
something that I don't know, by all means correct me.  I had the honor of
taking the Bursts class with the person who has done the modeling of these
different distributions, so we pretty much kicked around every possible
distribution there was, and some VERY outrageous sources. Colliding pulsars,
black holes, pulsars that are slowing down...stuff like that.   It's a fun
field.

 EVIDENCE OF ADL SPY OPERATION SEIZED BY POLICE
 
 By Richard C. Paddock, Times staff writer
 
 SAN FRANCISCO -- Police on Thursday served search warrants on the
 Anti-Defamation League here and in Los Angeles, seizing evidence of a
 nationwide intelligence network accused of keeping files on more than
 950 political groups, newspapers and labor unions and as many as
 12,000 people.
 
 Describing the spy operation in great detail, San Francisco
 authorities simultaneously released voluminous documents telling how
 operatives of the Anti-Defamation League searched through trash and
 infiltrated organizations to gather intelligence on Arab-American,
 right-wing and what they called "pinko" organizations.
 
 Representatives of the Anti-Defamation League, a well-known
 organization in the U.S. Jewish community dedicated to fighting
 anti-Semitism, declined detailed comment Thursday but denied breaking
 any laws.
 
 Police allege that the organization maintains undercover operatives to
 gather political intelligence in at least seven cities, including Los
 Angeles and San Francisco.
 
 Groups that were the focus of the spy operation span the political
 spectrum, including such groups as the Ku Klux Klan, the White Aryan
 Resistance, Operation Rescue, Greenpeace, the National Assn. for the
 Advancement of Colored People, the United Farm Workers and the Jewish
 Defense League.  Also on the list were Mills College, the board of
 directors of San Francisco public television station KQED and the San
 Francisco Bay Guardian newspaper.
 
 People who were subjects of the spy operation included former
 Republican Rep. Pete McCloskey, jailed political extremist Lyndon H.
 LaRouche and Los Angeles Times foreign correspondent Scott Kraft, who
 is based in South Africa.
 
 Authorities said much of the material collected by the groups was
 confidential information obtained illegally from law enforcement
 agencies.  They also alleged that data on some individuals and
 organizations was sold separately to the South African government.
 
 In addition to allegations of obtaining confidential information from
 police, the Anti-Defamation League could face a total of 48 felony
 counts for not properly reporting the employment of its chief West
 Coast spy, Roy Bullock, according to the affidavit filed to justify
 the search warrant.
 
 The Anti-Defamation League disguised payments to Bullock for more than
 25 years by funneling $550 a week to Beverly Hills attorney Bruce I.
 Hochman, who then paid Bullock, according to the documents released in
 San Francisco.  Hochman, a former president of the Jewish Federation
 Council of Greater Los Angeles and one of the state's leading tax
 attorneys, will be out of the city until late next week and could not
 be reached for comment, his office said.
 
 Until 1990, Hochman, a former U.S. prosecutor, also was a member of a
 panel appointed by then-Sen. Pete Wilson to secretly make initial
 recommendations on new federal judges in California.  Hochman is a
 former regional president of the Anti-Defamation League.
 
 The league, which initially cooperated with police, has denied
 repeatedly that its intelligence-gathering operation broke any laws.
 League officials will not confirm or deny whether Bullock was an
 employee and have said they simply traded information with police
 departments about people who might be involved in hate crimes.
 
 But in an affidavit filed to obtain warrants for Thursday's searches,
 San Francisco police alleged that "ADL employees were apparently less
 than truthful" in providing information during an earlier search
 conducted without a warrant.
 
 David Lehrer, executive director of the Los Angeles ADL office, said
 the organization has not violated the law.  "There is nothing
 nefarious about how we operate or what we have done," he said.  "Our
 record speaks for itself."
 
 The police affidavit contends that Lehrer had sole control of a secret
 fund used to pay for "fact-finding operations."  Lehrer, according to
 the documents, signed checks from the account under the name L.
 Patterson.
 
 An ADL official said the account was used to pay for subscriptions to
 a wide variety of extremist publications that might balk at sending
 them directly to the Anti-Defamation League.
 
 Bullock, 58, who has been collecting intelligence for the ADL for
 nearly 40 years, defended his efforts during a lengthy interview with
 San Francisco police.  He said that he gathered names from many
 sources and entered them into his computer under headings such as
 "Skins" and "Pinkos," but that did not necessarily mean that they were
 under surveillance.
 
 "I might never see or call up on 99% of them again," Bullock said.
 "And it doesn't mean anything that they're in the files.  It's not a
 threat to anyone's civil rights that a name appears in my files under,
 say, 'Pinko.'"
 
 In recent years, Bullock worked closely with San Francisco Police
 Officer Tom Gerard, who fled to the Phillippines last fall after he
 was questioned by the FBI in the case.
 
 A former CIA employee, Gerard supplied Bullock with criminal records
 and Department of Motor Vehicles information such as home addresses,
 vehicle registration, physical characteristics and drivers license
 photographs.
 
 Using files gathered for the Anti-Defamation League, Gerard and
 Bullock also provided information to the South African government,
 receiving $16,000 over four years, the documents show.
 
 The file on Times staff writer Kraft, which was apparently sold to the
 South African government, provides some insight into the hit-and-miss
 nature of the spy operation.
 
 The file notes that Kraft's articles "appear frequently in The Times
 and are well researched and written," but little else about the file
 is accurate.  The brief entry confuses The Times' Kraft with another
 Scott Kraft and provides the South African government with the wrong
 Kraft's physical description, photograph and other personal
 information.
 
 Nevertheless, the documents provide illuminating details of how
 Bullock for decades infiltrated all manner of organizations, from
 skinheads to left-wing radicals, searching regularly through the trash
 of target groups.  Using Anti-Defamation League funds, he also ran his
 own paid informants under code names such as "Scott" and "Scumbag."
 
 He worked closely with police officers up and down the coast,
 exchanged information with the FBI and worked with federal agencies,
 including the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.
 
 It was Bullock's work as a paid informant for the FBI -- while spying
 on behalf of the Anti-Defamation League and the South African
 government -- that proved his undoing. The FBI learned that he was an
 agent of a foreign government and began investigating, leading to the
 probe of the Anti-Defamation League's intelligence network.  The
 Anti-Defamation League employed undercover operatives to gather
 information in Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York, Washington,
 Chicago, St. Louis and Atlanta, according to the affidavit and
 investigators.  Joining San Francisco police in searching league
 offices and a Los Angeles bank were investigators from the office of
 San Francisco Dist. Atty. Arlo Smith and the state Franchise Tax
 Board.  The Los Angeles Police Department, which earlier refused to
 cooperate with the investigation, was informed of the searches in Los
 Angeles but not invited to participate.  Investigators suspect that
 some confidential information in the Anti-Defamation League files may
 have come from Los Angeles police officers.

 ADL VOWS TO COOPERATE WITH SPY INVESTIGATION
 
 By Richard C. Paddock, Times staff writer.
 
 SAN FRANCISCO -- The Anti-Defamation League defended its record as a
 civil rights group Friday and said it will cooperate with authorities
 who are investigating whether the organization collected confidential
 police information on citizens and groups.
 
 But San Francisco Dist. Atty. Arlo Smith said that Anti-Defamation
 League employees involved in intelligence gathering could face many
 felony counts of receiving confidential files, eavesdropping, tax
 violations and conspiracy.
 
 Police have accused the Anti-Defamation League of not being truthful
 about its spying operations, which collected information on more than
 12,000 individuals and 950 political groups across the political
 spectrum.
 
 Hundreds of pages of documents released by prosecutors Thursday show
 that the ADL maintained a nationwide intelligence network and kept
 files on political figures.
 
 Even so, Smith suggested that if the Anti-Defamation League shut down
 its spy operation, prosecutors would take that into account when
 deciding what charges to file.
 
 In a statement released in Washington, National Director Abraham H.
 Foxman described the ADL as "a Jewish defense agency which has fought
 to protect all minorities from bigotry and discrimination for 80
 years."
 
 Foxman said the organization is regarded as a credible source on
 extremist groups and has a tradition of routinely providing
 information to police, journalists, academics, government officials
 and the public.  It has never been the policy of the ADL to obtain
 information illegally, he said.
 
 "Like other journalists, in order to protect the confidentiality and
 physical safety of its sources, ADL will not comment on the nature or
 identity of any source of information," Foxman said.
 
 The Anti-Defamation League refused to acknowledge that one of its
 longtime employees, Roy Bullock, was anything more than "a private
 individual who is alleged to be an ADL 'informant.'"
 
 Among the documents released by prosecutors were detailed statements
 showing how the ADL funneled weekly payments to Bullock through
 Beverly Hills attorney Bruce I. Hochman.
 
 "Roy would penetrate organizations and needed this arrangement to be
 distanced from ADL," Hochman told a San Francisco police investigator.
 Hochman could not be reached Friday at his home or office for comment.
 
 Despite the Anti-Defamation League's assertion that it will cooperate
 with authorities, San Francisco police said the group did not turn
 over all pertinent documents during a voluntary search of the group's
 offices in Los Angeles and San Francisco last fall.
 
 A second round of searches Thursday, this time with search warrants,
 produced a vast quantity of records, primarily dealing with financial
 transactions, Smith said.  Further searches may be necessary and it
 will be at least a month before any charges are filed, he said.
 
 "The investigation, of course, will go wherever the facts lead us,"
 the district attorney said.

I would like to apologize for the typos in the previous post.

In retrospect I would also like to quote another source: Douglas C.
Haldeman from his 1991 book _Homosexuality_

THERAPY INEFFECTIVE

Recently the founders of yet another prominent "ex-gay" ministry, Exodus
International, denounced their conversion therapy procedures as ineffective.
Michael Busse and Gary Cooper, cofounders of Exodus International and lovers
for 13 years, were involved with the organization from 1976 to 1979.  The
program was described by these men as "ineffective . . . not one person was
healed."  They stated that the program often exacerbated already prominent
feelings of guilt and personal failure among the counselees; many were
driven to suicidal thoughts as a result of the failed "reparative therapy."

The previous article quoted in the last posting is from THE ADVOCATE, June
30, 1992 called "The Ex-Ex-Gay" by Robert Pela.

Some personal thoughts:

It is of no great astonishment that there is a concerted effort by a major
portion of the Church to control and mandate change of a minority among
its ranks.  This was the momentum behind the Spanish Inquisition, only all
they required was a confession of faith (after much torture) and then, to
save their souls they would dispatch them to heaven through death.  Even
later, the Bible was used vigorously to defend slavery, oppression and
segragation of African-Americans, even to the justification of lynchings.
Today's scholars are just a bit more slick in their approach.  The tool is
still coersion, but now it is mostly by means of brainwashing and mind
control, convincing people that they should see themselves as less than
God sees them, then maintaining a cultic hold on them until it is felt
thier mind-conditioning is complete.  Sure, no one is "physically" forced
to stay in this "reparative therapy" but sheer social pressure is enough for
many to keep themselves in this new found bondage of self-hate.

As an abolitionist I advocate the abolishment of oppression and persecution
against gays in all facets of civil life.  A person should be judged by
the contibution, or non-contribution to the society in which they live,
not by some high-brow standard of conformity imposed by those who haven';t
a clue what is in their heart.

For those who seek more information about Gays and groups that accept them
please contact your nearest chapter of PFLAG (Parents & Friends of Lesbians
And Gays) who will be more than happy to assist you.  This is a group of
people comprised of Gays, Lesbians and Bisexuals, their parents and friends
who have formed a support group for help and understanding.  Try talking to
a parent of a gay son or daughter and learn some "first-hand" real life and
loving understanding.  God's love and understanding for Gay people is no
less abundant.

Thank you.

Replace "Stephen" with "David Joslin," since you directed the same
accusation of hypocrisy at me.  In e-mail to me you wrote:
    In t.r.m. Robert Weiss writes [a promise from Psalm 9:10]
    Gee, since you wouldn't be at all hypocritical, you must be really
    busy arguing against these out-of-context extracted translations!

As you may recall, you mailed me six mail messages quoting articles by
Robert Weiss, all sent within a few minutes of each other.  You added:
    Naturally, I await your arguments against this out-of-context
    translation.  But I shall not await holding my breath...
and
    Wonder when you get to sleep, disputing all these out-of-context
    extracted translations!
and other similar comments. 

Perhaps you could explain why you ever thought that I might have a
reason to read all of these articles you pulled off of t.r.m, much
less write responses to them?

I am familiar with inductive logic.  Go ahead and give me the details
of the "logic" that led you to conclude, incorrectly, that I would
condone Robert Weiss taking verses out of context.  Your conclusion was
wrong, of course, since I agree that both you and Robert Weiss were
guity of taking verses out of context.  Nothing hypocritical about
that, is there?  

Since you reached a false conclusion, you made some mistake in your
"logic."  The only question is where.  Did you think that it would
be hypocritical for me not to post a reply to Robert Weiss' articles?
Did you make the common creationist error of confusing a lack of
evidence for X with evidence for the lack of X?   Is your grasp of
inductive logic not quite as firm as you think? See if you can figure
out what your mistake was, and learn from it.

If I have a habit that I really want to break, and I am willing to
make whatever sacrifice I need to make to break it, then I do so.
There have been bad habits of mine that I've decided to put forth the
effort to break, and I've done so; there have been other bad habits
that I've decided are not worth the effort to break.  It's my choice,
either way.

I am my own master.  I choose what I want to do.  I weigh the benefits
of my actions against their consequences, and I use my experience to
help me deal with the unexpected, which in turn make me more experienced.

I don't always succeed, but I never fail, either -- I learn.

Do *you* have any habits you can't break?  Why not?

>For one, you seem unable to master your lack of desire to understand
>even the slightest concept of the Bible.

I have arrived at my own understanding of Christianity, just as you've
probably arrived at your own understanding of Islam that is most
likely very different from the way a Moslem thinks of his religion.
Are you "unable to master your lack of desire to understand even the
slightest concept of the Quran"?  If that's different, then how is it
different from what you accuse me of?  Can I accuse you of having no
desire to understand even the slightest concept of atheism?

>How about sexual sins?  Gotta any of those secret desires

Of COURSE not.  That's disgusting.  For centuries, religions have been
discriminating on sex and treating women as second-class humans;
that's one of the reasons I renounced my Christianity.

No.  I don't insult people.  Period.  It's not in my nature, and it's
not something that I want to do, either.

Not yet -- but my life is the ground I use to practice on.  The fun is
in the getting there!

We don't start out perfect; we've got to strive to be something
better.  I know my shortcomings, and I know my strengths, and I live
my life according to the decisions I make, and I am content to abide
with the consequences of my decisions as easily as I'll accept the
praise for them.  There have been times in my life when I've made
mistakes, yes; I try to never make the same mistake twice.

I regard Christ as a myth.  I feel that there are far too many people
offering far too many interpretations of what he supposedly said and
did.  The only person who can really judge me is *me*.  I choose the
roads I travel, and I decide whether or not I want to reach the end of
any given road or turn back -- and as long as I don't *always* turn
back, there's no shame in it.  When I need help, I seek out my friends.

And you don't have a clue about what I'm saying, either.  Open your

Huh?  You're going WAY off the track here.

I say my mother loves me.  How do I know, you ask?  I can point to
definite things she's done for me, and I can even just bring her to
you so you can ask her, face-to-face.

You say your deity loves you.  How do you know, I ask?  You can't even
convince me that it exists!

If any god dangles 'heaven' before me like a carrot, promising untold
pleasures to me if I'll only suspend my disbelief and ignore my
rationality for just this once, then I would choose 'hell'.  I can
*not* lie to myself to placate another being, no matter how powerful
it is.

Note also that there are several gods trying to lure me this way:
Yahweh, Allah, Zeus, Odin, Ra...  Please give me a solid reason to
choose one of them over the others.

That paragraph demonstrates that you haven't listened to a single word
I've said.

Have you ever gone to an amusement park?  Why?  I mean, after a few
hours, it closes, and nothing's different except that you're a few
dollars lighter.  Going to the amusement park doesn't do you any good
at all.  Why do you do such a meaningless thing?

The answer is that you think it's fun.  You play the skee-ball over
and over because you'd like to get better at it, even though you're
not going to win anything better than a stuffed animal even if you
blow ten dollars on it.  You ride the roller coaster because it's an
thrilling experience, even though (because?) it scares the dickens out
of you.

In the same way, I think life is fun.  And I don't intend to leave the
amusement park of life until they close down for the night!  :-D

So you (and your holy book) say.  By the same token, therefore, Santa
Claus delivers toys every xmas.  Don't you see?  I have NO REASON to
believe that what you say is true.  Please give me some reason that I
can't similarly apply to Santa Claus.

I can't do it, because your existence means nothing more to me than
just your communications over the net.  You have no more bearing on
nor importance in my life than that; remove it, and you will cease to
be significant to me.

Are you thereby inferring that your deity is nothing more than a
collection of verses in a book, and cannot be supported without
invoking them?

Or do you mean that the existence of your deity (and, in fact, any
other deity that can be written about) is as real as your own
existence?

Why do you believe what you believe?

Go for it.  I have yet to see anybody justify the
prohibition on drugs and the ensuing War On Drugs.  In the world of
*.politics here on Usenet, it is YOU that is crazy.  ANYBODY--who gives
the matter any thought beyond reading headlines---cannot justify this
atrocity, this all out war on individual rights.

Well, there is a fair amount of evidence floating around that indicates
that OTO has been around since at least the late 1800s, long before
Crowley ever heard of it, how long has AMORC been around? (yes, I know
that they claim to have existed as an organization clear into prehistory,
but I doubt that they have any organizational paperwork
as a non-profit that can be carbon-dated to 20,000 BC)

The primary problem in human nature is a "fragmentation of being."
Humans are in a state of tension, a tension of opposites. Good and
evil are the most thought provoking polarities that come to mind.

The Bible provides us with many examples of the fragmentation of
being. The warring opposites within us are a product of man's
rebellion against God, which is described so vividly in the pages of
the Scriptures.

Man was created with the order to become a god. Those were the words
of St.  Basil in the fourth century. What he was trying to say was
that God created man to be a partaker of the divine nature. In the
Eastern Orthodox Church, this is called "theosis," or "deification."

One can also say that man was created to be whole, i.e. spirit, soul,
and body operating in unison. The story of Adam and Eve is a picture
of the archetypal humans before obtaining moral consciousness. Theirs
was a harmonious relationship with each other, the world, and the
Creator. That innocent harmony was shattered when they disobeyed God,
their natural wholeness falling apart into two seemingly
irreconcilable halves. Immediately, guilt and fear was manifested in
their lives. They become bound to hardship, toil, and suffering.  This
is symbolized in their exile from the paradisiac state.

The beast in the jungle does not possess moral consciousness. If it
were to receive this self-awareness, the knowledge of good and evil,
its paradisiac state would also be destroyed.

Was it the intention of the Creator to leave man in this state of
innocence all the days of his existence on earth? Or was the gaining
of self-awareness carefully staged by God, who did not desire that His
masterpiece, mankind, be a blissful idiot?

God must have known that, for mankind to achieve any kind of moral
value, he must pass through a confrontation with the opposites. There
is no other way to achieve union with God.

Jesus Christ is the answer to the problem of the warring polarities.
He was the perfectly integrated individual, reconciling the opposites,
and making it possible for us to be integrated, i.e. to become God,
not in His essence, but in His energies.

The opposites is THE Christian problem. The Apostle Paul describes it
with the utmost precision in Romans 7:15-24. And he follows with the
answer to his dilemma in vs 25.

An Easy way to solve the problem is to use two op-amps to form the
balanced low-Z output, but this solution does not provide any
galvanic isolation between keyboard (or whatever plugged) and
mixer. If no tight requiremets are demanded and some hum, snap,
crackle and pop sounds (formed by ground loops) can be tolerated,
the op-amp solution is just what you are looking for! (It is
cheap...somewhat $10/DI-box).
Not sure, but Craig Anderton did introduce one DI-box project
in Guitar Player mag years ago (transformerless).....

Why are you running away from the word of Jesus? Has somebody superseded
the word of Jesus? If you don't follow the morality of the Ten
Commandments and the Law and the Prophets and the word of Jesus, whose
morality do you follow?

Even easier, my area supports 311.  Dial this and a recording recites your number.
Phone techs use it to verify an installed line.

Are you (two) joking?

Ahh!, now I remember that Ohmite company was the first introducing "the pink

There is no need to include the VAT from previous levels because
the VAT is a "difference" tax...if the VAT is X%, than the amount
of tax the government receives through all the levels is X% of
the purchase price of the end consumer.  At the intervening levels,
only the difference between the VAT paid out and the VAT received
is remitted to the government.

A VAT is infinitely preferable to a retail sails tax...

I had spacefood sticks just about every morning for breakfast in
first and second grade (69-70, 70-71).  They came in Chocolate,
strawberry, and peanut butter and were cylinders about 10cm long
and 1cm in diameter wrapped in yellow space foil (well, it seemed
like space foil at the time).  

The taste is hard to describe, although I remember it fondly.  It was
most certainly more "candy" than say a modern "Power Bar."  Sort of
a toffee injected with vitamins.  The chocolate Power Bar is a rough
approximation of the taste.  Strawberry sucked.

Man, these were my "60's."

Who wants to look through the bars at some reactionary Liberal conspiracy-
theory idiots and see how they rant and rave at the erosion of their populist 
support?  This is very typical of the elitist Liberal attitude that The People 
are incapable of thinking for themselves.  This elitist attitude will be the
eventual undoing of the arrogant liberal tide sweeping America, as The People
begin to realize more and more that they are being treated like errant children
and robbed of their freedoms by a bunch of Utopian arrogent socialist jerks.

Although I find myself often disagreeing with the populist rationale
of Mr. Limbaugh, I find him entertaining and I often agree with his 
conclusions.  The fact that he sends liberal reactionaries like these
idiots through the roof makes him all the more entertaining.

Actually, I find Limbaugh's oratory less than sizzling and his debating
skills sometimes lacking, even though his conclusions are often correct.

I would suggest that a bankrupt leftist ideology that hopes to use concentrated 
political power and a loaded gun to force everyone to do the "right" things
(where "right" is defined by the elitist academics who lead the movement)
is showing an acute case of "myopic social perspective", not to mention
arrogance and utter stupidity.

Limbaugh is certainly far from perfect, but his opponents in the established
body politic and the media are the ones arguing for Federal control of
virtually all aspects of the lives of the Citizenry, and for the elimination
of local control over Affairs Public.  

Perhaps Limbaugh has a following because The People are tired of being treated 
like errant children by a self-important group of arrogant controlling myopic 
people who have no understanding of how life operates outside of the "oughta-be's"
inside their own hopelessly closed minds.

OK, let us take your word for that and work with it.  A nice specific

Hmmm, "Congress shall pass no law regarding an establishment of religion,
nor prohibiting the free exercise thereof."  Liberal translation: "the
federal government (as long as it is run by Liberals) may force local
school districts to include certain iconic content in Christmas displays,
while prohibiting others."

I think Limbaugh has you on this one.  It seems to me that he is arguing
for LESS imposition of the federal government into religion.

Nice job on the specificity of that one, too.

Ah yes, it is a conspiracy of profound proportions.  Methinks that you
may be a bit resentful of Mr. Limbaugh's success because you attribute it
primarily to luck (how, after all, could anyone with profound differences
of opinion from yourself have become successful without the operation of
conspiracy or blind luck!)  Do you feel this same level of knee-jerk
resentment against lottery winners, or do you congratulate them on their
good fortune?

This should be great fun, since it is the Liberal movement in America
that is pushing the hardest for centralized fascist control of The People
and business (government/business 'partnership' indeed), and Mr. Limbaugh 
is the populist nemesis of that movement.

I have read Mr. Limbaugh's book, and although it was not the most literary
piece I have read in recent memory it certainly did not contain "venom"
at all, let alone "venom" comparable to an individual who callously murdered
millions out of racism.



>On Their Own Qualifications to Control Society

>(page 577).

A very serious tone in that oratory.

You neglect to mention that Mr. Limbaugh (have you ever listened to his show, 
BTW?) continuously encourages his audience to think for themselves rather
than blindly following any media icon, himself included.  You yourself mention 
that he makes no bones about his show being strictly about his own opinions.
He also adopts a rather satirical approach, and presumes his audience to be
intelligent enough to distinguish satire from seriousness (and he says as much).
This is in contrast to the average mass-media show, in which the audience is
treated as society's intellectual lowest common denominator.

I am sure that Adolf Hitler was a master of satire; I am sure he was just
kidding when he said that the Jews were the cause of Germany's problems and
needed to be exterminated.



>On Religion as the Basis of a Nation
>        Hitler: "In this world human culture and civilization are

>sins against the benevolent Creator of this miracle and helps in the 
>expulsion from Paradise." (Page 581.)

This is not religion, it is clearly a perverse worship of race.  Since
Christ was a Jew, it seems quite unlikely that Hitler's characterization of
the Aryan as "the highest image of the Lord" fits with Christian doctrine.



>        Limbaugh: "America was founded as a Judeo-Christian country ...

>ambivalent toward religion ... People for whom belief in God is at best a

Private religious schools have a vastly better record of success than
publicly funded schools.  American history is indeed primarily Judeo-
Christian.  I suppose that Mr. Limbaugh pointing out facts is equivalent
to Adolf Hitler worshiping the Aryan race.  I think you might be reaching
just a wee bit here.



>On Popular Culture as a Reason for Social Collapse
>        Hitler: "The fight against the poisoning of the soul has to set in ... 
>One has only to look at the menus of our movie houses, vaudevilles and 
>theatres; and one can hardly deny that this is not the right kind of food ... 
>Theatre, art, literature, movies, the press, billposters and window displays 
>must be cleaned of the symptoms of a rotting world and put into the 
>service of a moral idea of State and culture." (pages 346 and 348.)

Definite suggestion that the government should control the entertainment
industry here.


>        Limbaugh: "Today, Hollywood is in trouble. The reason [is] that 
>Hollywood has forgotten who its audience is ... They make fun of people 
>who believe in God. They ridicule the traditional family, heterosexuality 
>and monagamy. They disparage American heroes." (page 254.)

Just a guess here, but I don't think that Mr. Limbaugh would advocate
government control of Hollywood.  You should perhaps call his radio show
to confirm this.  I believe this is more a criticism of Hollywood and the
depraved moral values it espouses, not an advocation of government control 
of Hollywood.

90's Liberals, on the other hand, want to have complete government control 
of our school systems, so that the government can teach The People at an
early age the "right" way to view religion and morality.  I believe Mr. 
Limbaugh is against this, as his satirical use of the "young heads full
of mush" hyperbole indicates.



>On the News Meida
>        Hitler: "The activity of the so-called liberal press was the work of 
>gravediggers for the German people and the German Reich. One can pass

>people's folkish and national spine, in order to make it ripe for the yoke of

Pretty strong conspiracy theory insinuated here, with an implicit plea for
government power to be used to break up the conspiracy.

>therefore they should defend this nation, they are hopelessly misguided 
>and, may I suggest, flirting with megalomania." (pages 270 and 268.)

Indication here that "Elements of the Media" (since career is a self-selected
categorization, perhaps an inferred 'larger percentage than represented in
the populace at large') has a leftist bias.  Doesn't sound too unreasonable.
No insinuation that CNN should not report in an objective fashion, only
that for reporters to say that they do not have any personal bias in the
situation is disingenuous to megalomaniacal.

You may disagree, and it may well be exagerrated, but it is not an unreasonable 
opinion; and Mr. Limbaugh goes well out of his way to make sure that his 
audience knows that these are his opinions, unlike most other reporting that 
purports to achieve perfect objectivity but in actuality will in some degree 
or other, in a statistical sense, reflect the biases of the reporters.  Who 
is being disingenuous here, Mr. Shaw or Mr. Limbaugh?

Again, you should ask Mr. Limbaugh himself, but I expect that he would
oppose government control of the media.

It is indeed depressing to see such myopia and tiresome Liberal arrogance.
Liberals love to play games with paradigms as a way of discrediting people
who disagree with them.  Why don't you challenge conservative ideology
on an intellectual level rather than engaging in ludicrous comparisons?
Perhaps the underpinnings of your ideology are intellectual only in that
they exist in your mind, not the real world.

Perhaps there are a few among the intellectually challenged who percieve
Rush Limbaugh as a hate-monger, but in my experience he has been spreading
laughter at the ludicrous self-importance of the Left, not hatred.

As to Mr. Bush, you may be correct about his fascist economic leanings.
Mr. Reagan, on the other hand, did his best to reverse the fascist trend
of government involvement in business.  Mr. Clinton is increasing fascism
in America through "business/government partnership" and increased levels
of taxation.  Perhaps you should not have skipped your vocabulary classes
in grade school.

Hmmm.  Seems to me that Limbaugh is not in any way comparable to Hitler
because he has not murdered six million Jews and many, many others out of
racism.  I come from a mixed-race family, so I am quite well attuned to
racism; I don't hear any coming from Rush Limbaugh.  The only place I hear 
racism coming from these days and being taken seriously is from the Liberal 
Left.

The Liberal Left is the movement I see trying to get America hooked
on the opiates of Socialized Medicine, Socialized Transportation, Socialized
Education, etc.  The Left already has America hopelessly addicted to 
that Liberal drug, the Social Security Chain Letter.  It is quite clear
to me that while the Hitler analogy does not really apply to either Rush 
Limbaugh or William Jefferson Clinton, if one of the two is closer than 
the other it is clearly the Fascist Clinton.

Hi, someone is selling his bmw R65 ( I think it's an '84 ) w/ 15k
miles for $2200. He says it's in great condition and perfect shape.
It's got the 2 hard saddle bags, too. 

Is this a good deal? Seems like an awesome deal. Is it - assuming that
everything he says is true ?

Thanks,

	It isn't so much a matter of 'interpretation' of Bible texts 
that sets Mormonism apart from orthodoxy as it is a matter of 
*fabrication*.

	About 20 years ago, _National Lampoon_ had some comic strips 
in them that were drawn by Neal Adams. They were called "Son o' God" comics. 
It was a parody of the Jesus in the Bible. In the comic, there were a 
group of thirteen Jewish kids from Brooklyn, and when one of them said 
the magic word, he turned into "Son o' God." He went from a myopic, 
curly headed, yarmulke wearing boy to a replica of the stylizied 
portraits of Jesus --- with long flowing brown hair and gentile 
features.	

	Now, if someone were to profess faith in this NatLamp Jesus, 
and claim that they were a Christian because they believed in this 
NatLamp Jesus, we would have to say that this was fallacious since 
this Jesus was a fabrication, and did not really exist.

	This is the exact same thing that the LDS do when they claim 
that they are Christian. They profess faith in Jesus, but the Jesus 
that they profess to have faith in is as much a fabrication as the 
NatLamp Jesus was.

One consideration to remember is that if you don't turn it off now,
you may not be able to later.  This isn't a case of reaching over and
flipping a switch; much of the spacecraft has to be working correctly
to execute a "turn off" command successfully.  Spacecraft do malfunction
in their old age.  The big concern is not radio clutter from idle
spacecraft, but radio clutter from malfunctioning spacecraft that can
no longer be turned off.

/If someone inflicts pain on themselves, whether they enjoy it or not, they

That is true.  It is also none of your business.  

Some people may also reason that by reading the bible and being a Xtian
you are permanently damaging your brain.  By your logic, it would be OK
for them to come into your home, take away your bible, and send you off
to "re-education camps" to save your mind from ruin.  Are you ready for
that?  





/(hudson)
/And why is there nothing wrong with it?  Because you say so?  Who gave you

Why?

Because: 
I am a living, thinking person able to make choices for myself.
I do not "need" you to show me what you think is the way; I have observed
too many errors in your thinking already to trust you to make up the
rules for me.

Because:
I set the standard for my *own* morality, and I permit you to do 
the same for yourself.  I also do not try to force you to accept my rules.

Because:
Simply because you don't like what other people are doing doesn't give you
the right to stop it, Hudson.  We are all aware that you would like for 
everyone to be like you.  However, it is obnoxious, arrogant thinking like 
yours, the "I-know-I'm-morally-right-so-I-can-force-it-on-you" bullshit 
that has brought us religious wars, pogroms against Jews, gay-bashing,
and other atrocities by other people who, like you, "knew" they were
morally right.

/(hudson)
/Aren't you?  Aren't you indicating that I should not tell other people what

It is not a moral standard that I am presenting you with, Hudson.  It is
a key to getting along in life with other people.  It is also a point of
respect:  I trust other people to be intelligent enough to make their
own choices, and I expect the same to be returned.  You, on the other
hand, do not trust them, and want to make the choice for them--whether
they like it or not.

It is also a way to avoid an inconsistency:  if you believe that you have 
the right to set moral standards for others and interfere in their lives, 
then you must, by logic, admit that other people have the same right of 
interference in your life.  
(Yes, I know; you will say that your religion is correct and tells you that
only agents acting in behalf of your religion have the right of interference.
However, other people will say that you have misinterpreted the Word of
God and that *they* are the actual true believers, and that you are
acting on your own authority.  And so it goes).





(hudson)

You can set all the standards that you want, actually.  But don't be surprised
if people don't follow you like rats after the Pied Piper.  

At the most basic form, I am not going to LET you tell me what to do;
and if necessary, I will beat you to a bloody pulp before I let you actually
interfere in my life.

Now, at a more humane level than that, I recognize that all people are
sentient beings possessed of intelligence and capable of reason.  I also
recognize that they, like I, appreciate being treated with respect and
allowed to make their own decisions.

If you are going to use one where it counts (eg:aviation, space scuttle,

for every other use you can buy a cheapie. I have a metex which is some 
made up name, as I have seen the same DMM with other brand names on it, I 
bought it about 4 yrs ago for Aus$125.00 (convert that to US and you see 
that it's definetly a cheapie.) So far it has proved to be accurate, taken 
moderate abuse, and has many features on it (CAP, FREQ,Transistor check, 
etc). I am very happy with it and would definetly not buy a fluke just for 
the name. Hope this helps.

Cheers

  Not with a hub cap but one of those "Lumber yard delivery
trucks" made life interesting when he hit a 'dip' in the road
and several sheets of sheetrock and a dozen 5 gallon cans of
spackle came off at 70 mph. It got real interesting for about
20 seconds or so. Had to use a wood mallet to get all the dried
spackle off Me, the Helmet and the bike when I got home. Thanks 
to the bob tail Kenworth between me and the lumber truck I had
a "Path" to drive through he made with his tires (and threw up
the corresponding monsoon from those tires as he ran over
what ever cans of spackle didn't burst in impact). A car in
front of me in the right lane hit her brakes, did a 360 and
nailed a bridge abutment half way through the second 360.

The messiest time was in San Diego in 69' was on my way
back to the apartment in ocean beach on my Sportster and
had just picked up a shake, burger n fries from jack in
the box and stuffed em in my foul weather jacket when the
milk shake opened up on Nimitz blvd at 50 mph, nothing
like the smell of vanilla milk shake cooking on the
engine as it runs down your groin and legs and 15 people
waiting in back of you to make the same left turn you are.

        Many of you at this point have seen a copy of the 
Lunar Resources Data Purchase Act by now. This bill, also known as the Back to 
the Moon bill, would authorize the U.S. 
government to purchase lunar science data from private 
and non-profit vendors, selected on the basis of competitive bidding, with an 
aggregate cap on bid awards of $65 million. 
        If you have a copy of the bill, and can't or don't want to go through 
all of the legalese contained in all Federal legislation,don't both - you have 
a free resource to evaluate the bill for you. Your local congressional office, 
listed in the phone book,is staffed by people who can forward a copy of the
bill to legal experts. Simply ask them to do so, and to consider supporting
the Lunar Resources Data Purchase Act.

My old jacket is about to bite the dust so I'm in the market for a new riding
jacket.  I'm looking for  recommendations for a suitable replacement.  I would
like to buy a full Aerostich suit but I can't afford $700 for it right now.

I'm considering two basic options:

1)  Buy the Aerostich jacket only.  Dunno how much it costs
    due to recent price increases, but I'd imagine over $400.
    That may be pushing my limit.  Advantages include the fact
    that I can later add the pants, and that it nearly eliminates
    the need for the jacket portion of a rainsuit.

2)  Buy some kind of leather jacket.  I like a few of the new 
    Hein-Gericke FirstGear line, however they may be a bit pricey
    unless I can work some sort of deal.  Advantages of leather
    are potentially slightly better protection, enhanced pose
    value (we all know how important that is :-), possibly cheaper
    than upper Aerostich.

Requirements for a jacket are that it must fit over a few other 
layers (mainly a sizing thing), if leather i'd prefer a zip-out 
lining, it MUST have some body armor similar to aerostich (elbows, 
shoulders, forearms, possibly back/kidney protection, etc.), a 
reasonable amount of pocket space would be nice, ventilation would 
be a plus, however it must be wearable in cold weather (below
freezing) with layers or perhaps electrics.

Please fire away with suggestions, comments, etc...

I am making a search for a CAD program that does a decent job
of making schematic drawings.  The program needs to be in
MS-DOS, Windows if possible.

What I want the CAD program to do is to draw diagrams by
dragging elements onto the screen, and in this the elements
needed are as diverse as vacuum tubes to ICs (case with pins).
It also needs to have provision for adding legends to the
components as well as their values.  In other words I want to
produce quality drawings.  Printout would be to either 24 pin
dot-matrix and/or Laser Printer.

If you know of such a CAD program that is of reasonable cost,
please respond.

	They are two witnesses who didn't come forth until after the first
trial.  While it would be "tough luck" for GM if they new about these witnesses
beforehand, IMO this constitutes "new evidence".

	No, I support rulings that deny new trials on those grounds.

A lot of people won't agree with me.  That's their right and I respect that.
However, to the point, Jews are also covered by the saving grace of Jesus
Christ.  There are Jews who have become Christians.

This brings up another question I still have to ponder:  why is there so 
much anti-Semitism?  Why do people hate Jews?  I don't hate Jews.  I consider
them to be like anyone else, sinners we all are.

Reported yesterday in the Washington Post (Kathy Sawyer, writer):

The article plays down the Russian role in US space.

Gibbons (science advisor to Clinton) sent Goldin a letter indicating
NASA should not limit redesign options to those compatible with Mir
orbit.

The White House thinks expectations for Russian cooperation have been
raised too high.

The article reports that some think the spending and schedule limits
for space station are so stringent that the redesign is nearly
impossible.  That's why some think Goldin has begun looking at 
Russian hardware.

Goldin states NASA will present all options to the administration 
which will then have decision making power.

Goldin and the White House have totally ruled out using Energia to
boost the station.

Some of these "cults", which seems like a rather dismissive term
to me, are pretty big here in the USA.  Most of them
are quite respectable & neiborly & do not resemble Branch Davidians
in the least; confusing them is a mistake.  What about "live &
let live", folks?  I'm sure we can uncover a few extremist loonies
who are Catholic -- the anti-abortion movement in the USA seems to have a
few hard cases in it, for example.

I have to agree Matthew with this; I have certainly encountered a lot
of anti-Catholic-religion propaganda & emotion (& some bigotry) from
members of certain religious groups here.  They also practice their
missionary work with zeal among Catholics in the United States, but to
someone who is or was raised Catholic such rhetoric is pretty
off-putting.  It may work better in an environment where there's a lot
of popular anti-clericalism.

Follow-ups set elsewhere, this no longer seems very relevant to Celtic issues
to me.

I addressed most of the key issues in this very long (284 lines) post
by Dean Kaflowitz in two posts yesterday.  The first was made into the
title post of a new thread, "Is Dean Kaflowitz terminally irony-impaired?"
and the second, more serious one appeared along the thread

"A Chaney Post, and a Challenge, reissued and revised"

both only in talk.abortion, but I am posting its contents into
talk.religion.misc as soon as I exit here.

This should be enough for us to thrash out for the next week or so.  The
second post really grapples with the main bones of contention between us.
The first is more lighthearted and tells about such things as 
KaflowitzDebatingPoints [tm], which he continues to rack up on both
talk.abortion and talk.religion.misc, while setting follow-ups to 
talk.abortion alone.  His lame excuse for the latter policy is that
he gets a prompt as to where to set follow-ups, and does not follow
talk.religion.misc much; this suggests that he is being hypocritical in not
also setting his Newsgroups line to talk.abortion alone.

GOT HIM!  Cramer is now claiming that pedophilia is a sexual orientation
rather than a chronicly homosexual condition.  This changes the whole
argument in as much that is pedophilia is a sexual orientation all
of its own peds cannot be called homosexual.  Peds are peds who
may have a preference as to the sex of the child they molest (though
most do not have a preference) but that is a subset of their basic
ped nature.

Cramer has as much as admitted that peds and gay men are different
orientations.  All we need now is to get him to admit that
the apparent similarities he keeps on about are just optical illusions.

The 1960's generation were the most spoiled and irresponsible.

The Depression had create mothers and fathers that were determined that their
kids would not want for anything -- going overboard and creating a nation of
brats.

Consider the contrast between two famous events in July of 1969.

Apollo 11 and Woodstock.

Which group had large numbers of people that could not feed themselves and
reverted to the cultural level of primitives (defecation in public etc.).

And which group assembled, took care of itself, and dispersed with no damage,
no deaths, no large numbers of drug problems ....

You're assuming that "go solar" = "photovoltaic".  Solar dynamic power
(turbo-alternators) doesn't have this problem.  It also has rather less
air drag due to its higher efficiency, which is a non-trivial win for big
solar plants at low altitude.

Now, you might have to replace the *rest* of the electronics fairly often,
unless you invest substantial amounts of mass in shielding.

[I was not and am not 'pretending' anything; I am *so* pleased you are
not surprised, though.]

>No, it is nothing like perpetual motion.  

Note that I didn't say it was perpetual motion, or even that it
sounded like perpetual motion; the phrase was "sounds almost like
perpetual motion", which I, at least, consider a somewhat different
propposition than the one you elect to criticize.  Perhaps I should
beg your pardon for being *too* precise in my use of language?

>The physics is well
>understood; the energy comes from fission of actinides in subcritical
>assemblies.  Folks have talked about spallation reactors since the
>1950s.  Pulsed spallation neutron sources are in use today as research
>tools.  Accelerator design has been improving, particularly with
>superconducting accelerating cavities, which helps feasibility.  Los
>Alamos has expertise in high current accelerators (LAMPF), so I
>believe they know what they are talking about.

I will believe that this process comes even close to approaching
technological and economic feasibility (given the mixed nature of the
trash that will have to be run through it as opposed to the costs of
separating things first and having a different 'run' for each
actinide) when I see them dump a few tons in one end and pull
(relatively) clean material out the other.  Once the costs,
technological risks, etc., are taken into account I still class this
one with the idea of throwing waste into the sun.  Sure, it's possible
and the physics are well understood, but is it really a reasonable
approach? 

And I still wonder at what sort of 'burning' rate you could get with
something like this, as opposed to what kind of energy you would
really recover as opposed to what it would cost to build and power
with and without the energy recovery.  Are we talking ounces, pounds,
or tons (grams, kilograms, or metric tons, for you SI fans) of
material and are we talking days, weeks, months, or years (days,
weeks, months or years, for you SI fans -- hmmm, still using a
non-decimated time scale, I see  ;-))?

>The real reason why accelerator breeders or incinerators are not being
>built is that there isn't any reason to do so.  Natural uranium is
>still too cheap, and geological disposal of actinides looks
>technically reasonable.

                            PRESS BRIEFING
                       BY GEORGE STEPHANOPOLOUS


                          The Briefing Room


 10:10 A.M. EDT
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As you know, the President is soon 
to be on his way, on Amtrack to Camden Yards.  He'll be throwing out 
the first pitch.
	     
	     Q	  It's MARC, the Maryland Area Transit, it's not 
Amtrack.
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Oh, it's not Amtrack?  Well, he's 
going from Union Station, you're right.  Excuse me.
	     
	     Q	  George, what exactly are you prepared to do to 
break the logjam with  ??? Senate?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, as you know, there are 
discussions between Senator Mitchell and Senator Dole this morning, 
and I think that the President is going to continue to make the point 
that he believes that our investment package, our jobs package needs 
to be passed as quickly as possible.  We need this investment for 
summer jobs, for immunization, for highway construction, for the 
important programs that will put people back to work right away this 
summer.  And the President continues to believe his program should be 
passed.
	     
	     Q	  Will he compromise, that's the question?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, as you know, the discussions 
are going on this morning in the Senate betwen Senator Mitchell and 
Senator Dole, let's see what they come up with.  But the President 
believes his jobs program should go forward.
	     
	     Q	  George, would the President be willing to accept $8 
billion for one year, which apparently appears to be the compromise 
being offered by --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I don't know what is being 
offered by either side.  The Senate discussions are going on right 
now, let's see what happens today.
	     
	     Q	  Would he go that far -- no matter what the 
Republicans have offered so far, would he go that far, $8 billion per 
year?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President believes that his 
program should be passed at this time.  Clearly, we're going to be 
willing to listen to what the Senators might or might not be able to 
come up with, but I'm not going to get into figures right now.  Let's 
see what happens.
	     
	     Q	  It's reasonable to assume, isn't it, from what has 
happened so far that a compromise is going to be necessary in order 
to get a vote?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the Republicans seem more 
intrested in stopping progress on the President's jobs bill, than in 
doing something to create --  MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the 
Republicans seem more interested in stopping progress on the 
President's jobs bill than in doing something to create real action, 
real jobs this summer for the American people.  I think there's no 
question about that.  There's been some frustration of legislative 
activity over the last few days.
	     
	     Q	  So, you'll need to compromise to get your package 
through?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We'll see what happens with the 
conversations between Senator Mitchell and Senator Dole this morning.
	     
	     Q	     prepared to compromise --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President's prepared to listen 
to what Senator Mitchell has to say this morning after his meeting 
with Senator Dole. 
	     
	     Q	  Does he feel that he has been defeated in his --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not in the least.  In fact, he's 
been very successful so far in the beginning of his term.
	     
	     Q	  How?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He passed his budget in record 
time, in six weeks, and it's a budget which reduces the deficit by 
$500 billion over five years.  And it's a budget which provides for 
important investments in our future.  Right now we've also had strong 
passage of his jobs program through the House.  Simply because a 
minority of Republicans in the Senate choose to perpetuate gridlock 
and hold up action on the President's jobs program is not a sign that 
he is not succeeding overall.
	     
	     Q	  He can't beat this, can he?
	     
	     Q	  The fact is they can do that?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the Republicans can stop 
action.  There's no question about that.
	     
	     Q	  What are you going to do about it?
	     
	     Q	  George, what do you know about these alleged notes 
taken by Boris Yeltsin during one of the meetings in which it appears 
that the President told Boris Yeltsin not to trust the Japanese; that 
when they say yes they mean no?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that's a complete 
misreading of what happened at the meeting.  The context of the 
conversation was that President Clinton was actually reassuring 
President Yeltsin at the time about his conversations with Prime 
Minister Miyazawa over the Kuril Islands and the Prime Minister's 
belief that Japan would play a constructive role in the G-7 process.  
I mean this was a casual comment about Japanese courtesy and 
etiquette but overall it was in the context of a conversation where 
he was reassuring President Yeltsin that he believed the Japanese 
were serious about their commitment to the G-7 process.
	     
	     Q	   Are you saying that the President said that when 
the Japanese say yes they mean no?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's not -- I don't know the 
exact words and there was a much longer discussion about he did say 
something along the lines that he believes that on this issue Prime 
Minister Miyazawa intends to really go forward with the G-7 process.
	     
	     Q	  Have there been any attempts to explain this to the 
Japanese because apparently the Japanese press has picked this up and 
there appears to be --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I've seen the reports in the 
Japanese press and it actually does put the situation in context.  It 
does talk about the Japanese -- understanding the Japanese points of 
view.  I don't think it's going to be a problem.  I believe that 
there may have been some diplomatic context just to clear things up 
but I'm not positive.
	     
	     Q	  George, was the specific comment that was made 
specific to the Kuril Island situation or was it a general 
observation on Japanese etiquette?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The discussion was about --
	     
	     Q	  The specific comment is what I'm asking about that 
has alleged to have been translated from the Russian notes, "when the 
Japanese say yes they mean no."
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, it was a combination.  I mean 
I don't think that's the whole sentence.  I think that the specific 
comment was a broad, general observation followed up by a specific 
finish to the sentence where he said in this case he believes that 
Prime Minister Miyazawa means to keep the commitment.
	     
	     Q	  Was he saying it facetiously first?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think it was just a casual 
observation.
	     
	     Q	  And then you say diplomatic contacts were made to 
clear it up.  Has the President sent a message?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, I don't think the President 
spoke; I believe that Secretary Christopher has made some calls but 
I'm not sure exactly how many.
	     
	     Q	  Well, this obviously is a bigger deal than you're 
making it out to be if Christopher has had to make some calls.
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, no.  It was just that we got 
the reports in Vancouver and the Secretary wanted to make sure that 
it was understood and make sure there was absolutely no 
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  -- reports in Vancouver, and the 
Secretary wanted to make sure that it was understood, and make sure 
there is absolutely no misunderstanding, and I don't believe there is 
on.
	     
	     Q	  What is our position about the Japanese?  That they 
may have to say one thing, but actualy mean another?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.  The position on the Japanese 
is as the President stated to President Yeltsin throughout the two 
days.  He said that he had had a good conversation with Prime 
Minister Miazawa prior to the Summit.  He reiterated the U.S. 
position, the long-standing support for the Japanese position on the 
Kuril Islands, but also reiterated Prime Minister Miazawa's 
commitment to move forward on the G-7 process and to play a 
constructive role.  And I think President Yeltsin was very glad to 
hear that.
	     
	     Q	  After listening to Secretary Christopher on Iraq 
for the last few days, I'm a little confused.  What is the U.S. 
policy?  Do you want to see Saddam Hussein overturned?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's the same policy that Secretary 
Christopher has reiterated, and all of the U.S officials have 
reiterated.  We expect full and complete and unequivocal compliance 
with all U.N. resolutions.  Right now we do not have that compliance.
	     
	     Q	     throwing it out further that if Iraq complies, 
Saddam can't stay in office?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Right.  I think that that's -- our 
judgment is that it is not possible for Saddam Hussein to comply with 
the resolutions and stay in power.  But the important point is that 
we expect compliance by Iraq with all U.N. resolutions, and we will 
continue to demand it.
	     
	     Q	  And are you concerned the Iran will become the 
dominant power in the area --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Secretary Christopher has also 
spoken to Iran over the last several days, and he says we also expect 
full Iranian compliance with all international norms, and stopping 
support of terrorism.
	     
	     Q	  That's a very glib statement that he won't stay in 
power if he complies with U.N. resolutions.  On what logic do you 
base that?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Right now Saddam Hussein is not 
complying with the U.N. resolutions at all.  He is not respecting the 
rights of his people, as is required by the U.N. resolution.  He is 
not fully complying with all the resolutions regarding inspections.  
He is not fully complying with all the resolutions regarding 
armaments.
	     
	     Q	  Well, when do you think that if he did comply he 
would be out of power?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, right now his power rests on 
the repression of his people.  If he stopped doing that it would make 
it more difficult for him to stay in power.
	     
	     Q	  George, back on the stimulus package, why is it 
that you and the President accuse the Republicans of playing pure 
politics and perpetuating gridlock?  Why is it that -- what evidence 
do you have that they just don't have a genuine idealogical 
difference with you that's in good faith?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the fact that several times 
in the past the Republicans, many of the ones who are now leading the 
fight for the filibuster, have supported the very funding they now 
seek to stop, most especially, the highway funding.  
	     
	     Q	  George, in regards to that, some of the moderate 
Republicans said that the White House erred by not being more open to 
them during the -- while the plan was put together, that they had 
one, sort of, proforma meeting between the White House and the Senate 
Republicans, and that was it.  Does the Administration look back and 
thinks perhaps it could have done a better job of working with some -
-
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I'm not sure that it's true 
that there was only one meeting.  I mean, the President met with the 
Republican leadership on at least two occasions before the 
introduction of his package.  He met with the entire Senate 
Republican Caucus also for lunch, and went up there.  We are 
continually in contact with as many Republicans as we can find who 
have an interest in the President's package.  We are interested in 
what they have to say, as well.  But we believe that this program is 
important, and we're going to continue to fight for it.
	     
	     Q	     your all or nothing, do it with the Democrats 
alone strategy, did you maybe miscalculate the ability to get it 
through?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I mean, I think that there is 
no question that under the Senate rules a determined minority can 
frustrate activity.  I mean, there is just no question about that.  
You only need 40 plus one to keep going.  40 plus one to keep going 
and to stop any action, and that's what the Republicans are doing.
	     
	     Q	     going to rethink the way you attempt to get 
other things passed as you go through this process for the rest of 
the summer?
	     
	     Q	     work with Republicans and try to woo some 
Republicans into your camp?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think we're going to continue to 
look for the support of Republicans whenever we can get it on the 
President's intiatives?
	     
	     Q	  But on this one -- how are you going to do it 
differently than you did it on this one because on this one you 
really did stiff the Republicans from the beginning and made it clear 
that it was a Democratic majority that would get this through and 
could get it through and you really didn't need Republican votes?  
Are you going to take a different tack when you have to go for 
particular votes?  When you have to go through --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I can't see into the future and 
understand every possible turn in the legislative road.  Clearly the 
President's going to continue to reach out when he can.
	     
	     Q	  You don't have any regrets then about the way you 
have handled it up to now and you don't plan any changes in your 
approach in dealing with the Republicans in Congress based on this 
experience?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Obviously the President would like 
his package passed as quickly as possible and he's going to continue 
to press for that.  We will continue to reach out to Republicans, 
there's not question about that.  And we'll continue to reason with 
them and try and find appropriate avenues for cooperation.  In this 
case the Republicans have chosen to unify around a filibuster, around 
a plan to frustrate action not a plan to move forward.
	     
	     Q	  They're being denied any other legislative means of 
putting their proposals forward.
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think they're being --
	     
	     Q	     any ideas.
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think their amendments are being 
defeated; I don't know that they're being denied.
	     
	     Q	     to present them.
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's not exactly true.  I mean 
they get the votes --
	     
	     Q	     that theirs can be passed though by the 
parliamentary rules under which they're playing.
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Unless they get a majority in 
support all the way around, no, that's not exactly true.
	     
	     Q	  George, one more on Iraq.  Is the administration 
backing any of the Iraqi opposition?  Grooming any new leadership?
	     
	     Q	     backing any of the Iraqi -- leadership?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Oh, I -- again, we're pressing for 
Iraqi compliance.  I don't know if we can get into the business of 
grooming leadership.  I believe there have been some contacts, at 
some levels, with Iraqi opposition groups.  I don't know  about 
anything recently.
	     
	     Q	     Jesse Jackson, who, of course, is not the 
President's best friend, has, however, been told that there is to be 
some kind of town meeting, or some kind of involvement by the 
President, pre-empted the ball game -- Los Angeles.  Will he consider 
something like that, or any other kind of intervention there?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, as you know, the President 
appointed Commerce Secretary Ron Brown, about 10 days ago, to be a 
special envoy to California, and coordiante cabinet activities around 
the California economic situation, including the situation in Los 
Angeles.  
	     
	     I believe there will also be visits out to Los Angeles 
by the Education -- or have been visits by the Education Secretary, 
Mr. Riley.  I believe that Transportation Secretary Pena and HUD 
Secretary Cisneros are also going out.  And there may be other visits 
by Cabinet officials over the next several days and weeks.  I 
wouldn't rule out the possibility of a visit by President Clinton to 
California.  Obviously, he is following the situation closely, and is 
concerned about making sure that we make the right long term policy 
decisions that will help create the kind of economic opportunities 
which help prevent disturbances.  But we're going to continue to 
watch it.
	     
	     Q	  George, as a follow-up, Reverend Jackson is also 
supposed to be outside the ball park today, in Baltimore, with a 
group of supporters protesting the lack of minorities in baseball 
management.  Does the President have a position on that?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President has received 
correspondence from Reverend Jackson.  I know that Reverend Jackson 
has also spoken with the White House Chief of Staff, Mack McLarty.  
He clearly raises serious questions.  There has been some progress in 
baseball over the last several years, but still not enough.  But the 
President intends to continue to go to the ball game.
	     
	     Q	  Is he going to say anything about it today, or see 
Reverend Jackson while he's out there?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if he is going to see 
them, but as I said, the President believes that Reverend Jackson has 
raised some serious questions, and it's something that, as I said, 
even though there has been progress, it's clearly not enough.
	     
	     Q	  Did Reverend Jackson ask him not to go to the ball 
game?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not sure about that.  I believe 
the characterization the Reverend Jackson is talking about is an 
informational pickett.  I don't know that he asked him not to go to 
the ball game, but he sent a long, detailed, formal letter outlining 
his concerns with the situation in major league baseball and the 
President read it.
	     
	     Q	  George, the Orioles are playing the Rangers, the 
managing partner of the Rangers is George W. Bush.  Is he going to be 
there, and is he going to meet with the President?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know.
	     
	     Q	  What is the Mubarak schedule?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I know that President Mubarak is 
coming tomorrow morning for a working meeting, they will have a 
lunch, and I believe that he is having dinner tonight with Vice 
President Gore.
	     
	     Q	  And joint statements tomorrow --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I believe so, yes.  At the end, 
yes.
	     
	     Q	  Is there evidence, George, that the Egyptians did 
warn the U.S. about a potential terrorist bombing -- terrorist 
activities?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As reported in The New York Times, 
I mean, I think that President Mubarak did say that there has been 
general conversations with the Egyptians, as there have been for a 
long period of time.  We do have general intelligence sharing, I 
mean.  But President Mubarak was very careful to point out that there 
was no specific information on this visit that was passed forward.  
The President will continue to investigate the situation, but he also 
reiterates his belief that we cannot tolerate terrorism of any kind.
	     
	     Q	  George, he did make specific -- or the Egyptians, 
apparently, did issue specific warnings about this individual who, 
forgive me --this individual who, forgive me the name escapes me at 
the moment, and said the Egyptians were more or less rebuffed in 
their attempts to get some kind of action.
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I don't know if I would 
agree with your characterization of the Mubarak interview.  He did 
say that they gave general warnings about the possibility of a 
network in the United States and upon which we took appropriate 
action.  But there was no specific information on this specific 
operation at all.
	     
	     Q	  So, the White House doesn't feel that any of the 
law enforcement agencies whether it be the CIA or FBI who would have 
received this kind of information was lax or derelict in its duty in 
not pursuing some kind of --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, not at all.
	     
	     Q	  What's next with Serbia?  It got only a passing 
mention in the news conference yesterday --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  You didn't get to ask your 
question.
	     
	     Q	  Yes, exactly.  Was there any agreement on concerted 
action between the two countries?  And even if there wasn't, what 
does the U.S. do next?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think the U.S. is clearly going 
to move forward in the U.N. today continuing discussions with our 
allies on a sanctions resolution and we'll continue to look for ways 
to press the Serbians to come to the negotiating table and sign an 
agreement.
	     
	     Q	  George, why do you think sanctions is still an 
option?  I mean the Serbians make it clear that at least the 
leadership is surviving just fine and they feel like they can wait 
you out and even the administration officials we had in the other day 
said there's no evidence that they're going to have an effect any 
time soon.  The Bosnian Serbs have said no to the peace plan.  When 
does no mean no and you have to do something different?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I mean we are doing something 
different.  We're moving forward on further sanctions through the 
U.N. and those discussions will continue.  We're going to continue to 
try and tighten the noose on Serbia, and I think that every 
opportunity we have to do that will have an effect over time.
	     
	     Q	  Are we looking again at lifting the arms embargo? 
MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President has said that this is something 
that is under consideration.
	     
	     Q	  George, do you have any more on Hugh Rodham's 
condition, how he's doing?

after the Mubarak visit.
	     
	     Q	  Is he going somewhere for Easter?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not that I know of.
	     
	     Q	  What more can you tell us about the additional aid 
to Russia that the President plans to ask Congress about?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He's going to be consulting with 
the Congress and with our G-7 partners over the next couple of weeks.  
I know that he spoke last evening with Congressman Gephardt and their 
delegation before the -- the congressional delegation meets with the 
Russians this week and those consultations will continue over the 
next several weeks.

week and he's going to review the list, and we're going to take a 
hard look at it.
	     
	     Q	  But they're making it up?  I mean it's no White 
House involvement, Congress is compiling this list?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think he's going to talk to the 
congressional leaders about compiling the list but I'm certain we'll 
be able to get our own researchers working as well.
	     
	     Q	  George, isn't lifting the arms embargo more of a

of time and -- for months before that happens.
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, all I can say is that it's 
something that the President is reviewing.  Right now we're working 
with our allies in the U.N on a sanctions resolution, and we'll 
continue to review other matters.
	     
	     Q	  George, can you tell us anything about the schedule

Hi. I have been thinking about buying a Motorcycle or a while now and I have
some questions:

-Is there a buying guide for new/used motorcycles (that lists reliability, how
to go about the buying process, what to look for, etc...)?
-Is there a pricing guide for new/used motorcycles (Blue Book)?

Also
-Are there any books/articles on riding cross country, motorcycle camping, etc?
-Is there an idiots' guide to motorcycles?

ANY related information is helpful. Please respond directly to me.

Thanks a lot.

INteresting question about Galileo.

Galileo's HGA  is stuck.   

The HGA was left closed,  because galileo  had a venus flyby.

If the HGA were pointed att he sun,  near venus,  it would
cook the foci elements.

question:  WHy couldn't Galileo's  course manuevers have been
designed such that the HGA  did not ever do a sun point.?

After all,  it would normally be aimed at earth anyway?

or would it be that an emergency situation i.e. spacecraft safing

Dogs will chase anything that moves. I have two dogs and they love
chasing me when I ride off. They will also chase any car that passes
, running along the footpath/sidewalk at up to 60kph. They don't
seem to go after trucks though, the size difference must be a factor.

It also works in my favour though, I can exercise them quite easily
by riding 1/2 mile up the road and back a few times.

Except for their size, the cooling towers on nuclear power plants
are vertually identical in construction and operation to cooling
towers designed and built in the 1890's (a hundred years ago) for
coal fired power plants used for lighting and early electric railways.

Basicly, the cylindrical tower supports a rapid air draft when
its air is heated by hot water and/or steam circulating thru a network
of pipes that fill about the lower 1/3 of the tower. To assist cooling
and the draft, water misters are added that spray cold water over the
hot pipes. The cold water evaporates, removing the heat faster than
just air flow from the draft would and the resulting water vapor is
rapidly carried away by the draft. This produces the clouds frequently
seen rising out of these towers.

That slight pinch (maybe 2/3 of the way up the tower) is there because
it produces a very significant increase in the strength and rate of
the air draft produced, compared to a straight cylinder shape.

The towers are used to recondense the steam in the sealed steam
system of the power plant so that it can be recirculated back to the
boiler and used again. The wider the temperature difference across
the turbines used in the power plant the more effecient they are and
by recondensing the steam in the cooling towers before sending it
back to the boilers you maintain a very wide temperature difference
(sometimes as high as 1000 degrees or more from first stage "hot"
turbine to final stage "cold" turbine).

[Note: I just tried to figure this stuff out about a month ago myself, from
various people on the net, so I could be wrong.]

The data is only ever read once (barring mistracks and such, of course),
and eventually gets turned into 44.1 KHz, 16 bit, two channel data.
Oversampling takes two discrete data points, and interpolates n-1 points
between them for n times oversampling.  When I asked, people said that the
interpolation was not simply linear interpolation, but significantly more
complicated.

Anyway, then, the purpose of oversampling is to move the "effective"
sampling rate up to n times 44.1 KHz, in order to use higher frequency
antialiasing filters.  For the same quality filter, higher oversampling
lets you build cheaper filters, whereas for the same price filter, higher
oversamplings lets you build better filters.  So, assuming the quality of
all other components in a CD player remained the same, oversampling should
allow a manufacturer to produce _slightly_ better sound due to anti-alias
filtering.

First, people should be aware that Brett's (no last name listed) 
posts on bit.listserv.politics indicate that he has been  
hostile toward GM's hiring policies and to the Moseley verdict 
when it came out.  Equal opportunity disagreement, I guess.  :-)

My guess, without seeing the judge's opinion, is that GM's motion 
was denied on due diligence grounds.  Otherwise, a party to a 
case could always keep one or two semi-credible witnesses in 
reserve to spring if they lose.  Not exactly a way to promote 
repose.

Blacks have the same (+- 2%) crime report rate, arrest rate, and incarceration
rate for violent crimes.

So I doubt that for violent crimes, that there is any inherent bias mechanism
present.

There is a wider discrepancy for all crimes for blacks wrt to 3 categories.

Interestingly enough, the discrepancy is the largest in the Southern
United States -- where blacks are incarcerated well BELOW the average in
the rest of the United States! Which points to an anti-bias-against wrt
blacks.

In any case, for violent crimes and burglary and drug selling, blacks are
reported 53%, arrested 44%, and are present in jails/prisons 47% (1988).

Considering that 12% of the population is black, 6% are black males, and
some percentage of that is out of the high/low age groups, we do have a
situation where (if I remember my old calculations right) 4% of the
population commits almost half of the really nasty crimes.

Blacks with similar histories (crime) to whites get the same sentences,
except in the South, where they receive around 20% less on paper!!

I"M CHANGING MY NAME TO CHRYSLER
(Tom Paxton, 1980)

Oh the price of gold is rising out of sight
And the dollar is in sorry shape tonight
What the dollar used to get us
Now won't buy a head of lettus
No the economic forecast isn't right
But amidst the clouds I spot a shining ray
I caneven glimpse a new and better way
And I've devised a plan of action
Worked it down to the last fraction
And I'm going into action here today.

Chorus:

  I am changing my name to Chrysler
  I am going down to Washington D.C.
  I will tell some power broker
  What they did for Iacoca
  Will be perfectly acceptable to me.
  I am changing my name to Chrysler
  I am heading for that great receiving line
  So when they hand a million grand out
  I'll be standing with my hand out
  Yes sir I'll get mine

When my creditors are screaming for their dough
I'll be proud to tell them all where they can go
They won'y have to scream and holler
They'll all be paid to the last dollar
Where the endless streams of money seam to flow
I'll be glad to tell them all what they can do
Its just a matter of a simple form or two
It's not renumeration it's a liberal education
Ain't you kind of glad that I'm in debt to you

Chorus

Since the first first amphibians crawled out of the slime
We've been struggling in an unrelenting climb
We were hardly up and walking before money started talking
And it's sad failure is an awful crime
It's been that way for a millennium or two
But now it seems there's a different point of view
If you're a corporate titanic and your failure is gigantic
Down in congress there is a safety net for you.

Chorus...



Perhaps Steven Jobs should take Paxton's advice and change his name to
Chrysler, or perhaps set himself up as an S&L, maybe Neil Bush could
give him a hand?

You got off cheap.  My sister's ex-boyfriend was such an incessant pain
in the ass about wanting to ride my bikes (no way, Jose) that I
finally took him to Lindner's BMW in New Canaan, CT last fall where
I had seen a nice, used K100RS in perfect condition.  After telling
everyone in the shop his Norton war stories from fifteen years ago,
signing the liability waiver, and getting his pre-flight, off he went...

Well, not quite.  I walked out of a pizza shop up the street,
feeling good about myself (made my sister's boyfriend happy and got
the persistent wanker off my ass for good), heard the horrendous
racket of an engine tortured to its red line and then a crash.  I
saw people running towards the obvious source of the disturbance...
Jeff laying under the BMW with the rear wheel spinning wildly and
someone groping for the kill switch.  I stared in disbelief with
a slice hanging out of my mouth as Matty, the shop manager, slid
up beside me and asked, "Friend of yours, Steve?".  "Shit, Matty,
it could have been worse.  That could been my FLHS!"

Jeff hadn't made it 10 inches.  Witnesses said he lifted his feet
before letting out the clutch and gravity got the best of him.
Jeff claimed that the clutch didn't engage.  Matty was quick.
While Jeff was still stuttering in embarrassed shock he managed
to snatch Jeff's credit card for a quick imprint and signature.  Twenty
minutes later, when Jeff's color had paled to a flush, Matty
presented him with an estimate of $580 for a busted right mirror
and a hairline crack in the fairing.  That was for fixing the crack
and masking the damaged area, not a new fairing.  Or he could buy the
bike.

I'm not sure what happened later as my sister split up with Jeff shortly
afterwards (to hook up with another piece of work) except that Matty
told me he ran the charge through in December and that it went
uncontested.

What is best? Books have been written on that! But in regard to
AeroStich it really depends on your particular size, shape and needs.
If you upper and lower body are not proportional (according to aero
dimensions) then it probably is going to be better mixing and matching
the 2 piece suit. I have the 2 piece suit and I am very happy with it.
Having my life quota of scars from crashing off road, I am very
concerned with good protection and I believe that the difference in
protection between the 1 and 2 piece suits is almost negligible. I
think the optional hip pads and back protector make much more of a
difference. One thing that is nice about the 2 piece is if you go
somewhere and then want to walk around for a while (still with jacket)
you can just detach and stow the pants. 

One thing to note is that Goldfine has problems getting a good fit for
many women (with standard suits). Supposedly for smaller women (and
petite men for that matter) the 1 piece will fit better. 

Another recommendation is to pay for mods if you need them. I wish I
got 2-3 inches added to my pant legs. I find the Long suits are not
really that long (I can't imagine how short the standard suits must
be).

it has a boiling point of 365 degrees (much higher than

SEI Level 5 (the highest level -- the SEI stands for Software
Engineering Institute).  I'm not sure, but I believe that this rating
only applies to the flight software.  Also keep in mind that it was
*not* achieved through the use of sophisticated tools, but rather
through a 'brute force and ignorance' attack on the problem during the
Challenger standdown - they simply threw hundreds of people at it and
did the whole process by hand.  I would not consider receiving a 'Warning'
status on systems which are not yet in use would detract much (if
anything) from such a rating -- I'll have to get the latest copy of
the guidelines to make sure (they just issued new ones, I think).

Also keep in mind that the SEI levels are concerned primarily with
control of the software process; the assumption is that a
well controlled process will produce good software.  Also keep in mind
that SEI Level 5 is DAMNED HARD.  Most software in this country is
produced by 'engineering practicies' that only rate an SEI Level 1 (if
that).

Too bad they didn't  give him a tour of the CGRO data?

I think he'd be fascinated by the Gamma ray bursters.  The mind of
hawking might even propose a mechanism.


SO what's a drag free satellite?   coated with WD-40?  carries an
aluminum-gold  set of grateful dead albums?   inquiring minds
want to know?

And why would MO  carry any features for being drag free?  I thought
aero-braking was a possible MO  experimental activity?

 Stick an ME33 on the front.  I've got a Laser on the front of my GPz,
and it has been a fantastic tire.  Best front tire I've ever had.

   Deltabox (tm) is a registered trademark of Yamaha, used to describe
their aluminum perimeter frame design, used on the FZR400 and FZR1000.
In cross-section, it has a five-sided appearance, so it probably really
should be called a "Pentabox".

Also in pure speculation:

Parity errors in memory or previously known conditions that were waivered.
   "Yes that is an error, but we already knew about it"

Any problem where they decided a backup would handle it.

Any problem in an area that was not criticality 1,2,3..., that is, any
   problem in a system they decided they could do without.

I'd be curious as to what the real meaning of the quote is.

                      LARSONIAN Astronomy and Physics

               Orthodox physicists, astronomers, and astrophysicists 
          CLAIM to be looking for a "Unified Field Theory" in which all 
          of the forces of the universe can be explained with a single 
          set of laws or equations.  But they have been systematically 
          IGNORING or SUPPRESSING an excellent one for 30 years! 

               The late Physicist Dewey B. Larson's comprehensive 
          GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, which he 
          calls the "Reciprocal System", is built on two fundamental 
          postulates about the physical and mathematical natures of 
          space and time: 
    
               (1) "The physical universe is composed ENTIRELY of ONE 
          component, MOTION, existing in THREE dimensions, in DISCRETE 
          UNITS, and in two RECIPROCAL forms, SPACE and TIME." 
    
               (2) "The physical universe conforms to the relations of 
          ORDINARY COMMUTATIVE mathematics, its magnitudes are 
          ABSOLUTE, and its geometry is EUCLIDEAN." 
    
               From these two postulates, Larson developed a COMPLETE 
          Theoretical Universe, using various combinations of 
          translational, vibrational, rotational, and vibrational-
          rotational MOTIONS, the concepts of IN-ward and OUT-ward 
          SCALAR MOTIONS, and speeds in relation to the Speed of Light 
          (which Larson called "UNIT VELOCITY" and "THE NATURAL 
          DATUM"). 
      
               At each step in the development, Larson was able to 
          MATCH objects in his Theoretical Universe with objects in the 
          REAL physical universe, (photons, sub-atomic particles 
          [INCOMPLETE ATOMS], charges, atoms, molecules, globular star 
          clusters, galaxies, binary star systems, solar systems, white 
          dwarf stars, pulsars, quasars, ETC.), even objects NOT YET 
          DISCOVERED THEN (such as EXPLODING GALAXIES, and GAMMA-RAY 
          BURSTS). 
          
               And applying his Theory to his NEW model of the atom, 
          Larson was able to precisely and accurately CALCULATE inter-
          atomic distances in crystals and molecules, compressibility 
          and thermal expansion of solids, and other properties of 
          matter. 

               All of this is described in good detail, with-OUT fancy 
          complex mathematics, in his books.

          should be available via inter-library loan if your local 
          university or public library doesn't have each of them. 

               Several of them, INCLUDING the last one, are available 
          from: The International Society of Unified Science (ISUS), 
          1680 E. Atkin Ave., Salt Lake City, Utah  84106.  This is the 
          organization that was started to promote Larson's Theory.  
          They have other related publications, including the quarterly 
          journal "RECIPROCITY". 

          

          Physicist Dewey B. Larson's Background
    
               Physicist Dewey B. Larson was a retired Engineer 
          (Chemical or Electrical).  He was about 91 years old when he 
          died in May 1989.  He had a Bachelor of Science Degree in 
          Engineering Science from Oregon State University.  He 
          developed his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the 
          physical universe while trying to develop a way to COMPUTE 
          chemical properties based only on the elements used. 
    
               Larson's lack of a fancy "PH.D." degree might be one 
          reason that orthodox physicists are ignoring him, but it is 
          NOT A VALID REASON.  Sometimes it takes a relative outsider 
          to CLEARLY SEE THE FOREST THROUGH THE TREES.  At the same 
          time, it is clear from his books that he also knew ORTHODOX 
          physics and astronomy as well as ANY physicist or astronomer, 
          well enough to point out all their CONTRADICTIONS, AD HOC 
          ASSUMPTIONS, PRINCIPLES OF IMPOTENCE, IN-CONSISTENCIES, ETC.. 
     
               Larson did NOT have the funds, etc. to experimentally 
          test his Theory.  And it was NOT necessary for him to do so.  
          He simply compared the various parts of his Theory with OTHER 
          researchers' experimental and observational data.  And in 
          many cases, HIS explanation FIT BETTER. 
    
               A SELF-CONSISTENT Theory is MUCH MORE than the ORTHODOX 
          physicists and astronomers have!  They CLAIM to be looking 
          for a "unified field theory" that works, but have been 
          IGNORING one for over 30 years now! 
    
               "Modern physics" does NOT explain the physical universe 
          so well.  Some parts of some of Larson's books are FULL of 
          quotations of leading orthodox physicists and astronomers who 
          agree.  And remember that "epicycles", "crystal spheres", 
          "geocentricity", "flat earth theory", etc., ALSO once SEEMED 
          to explain it well, but were later proved CONCEPTUALLY WRONG. 
    
    
               Prof. Frank H. Meyer, Professor Emeritus of UW-Superior, 
          was/is a STRONG PROPONENT of Larson's Theory, and was (or 
          still is) President of Larson's organization, "THE 
          INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY OF UNIFIED SCIENCE", and Editor of 
          their quarterly Journal "RECIPROCITY".  He moved to 
          Minneapolis after retiring. 
    


          "Super Collider" BOONDOGGLE!
          
               I am AGAINST contruction of the "Superconducting Super 
          Collider", in Texas or anywhere else.  It would be a GROSS 
          WASTE of money, and contribute almost NOTHING of "scientific" 
          value. 
    
               Most physicists don't realize it, but, according to the 
          comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the late Physicist 
          Dewey B. Larson, as described in his books, the strange GOOFY 
          particles ("mesons", "hyperons", ALLEGED "quarks", etc.) 
          which they are finding in EXISTING colliders (Fermi Lab, 
          Cern, etc.) are really just ATOMS of ANTI-MATTER, which are 
          CREATED by the high-energy colliding beams, and which quickly 
          disintegrate like cosmic rays because they are incompatible 
          with their environment. 
    
               A larger and more expensive collider will ONLY create a 
          few more elements of anti-matter that the physicists have not 
          seen there before, and the physicists will be EVEN MORE 
          CONFUSED THAN THEY ARE NOW! 
    
               Are a few more types of anti-matter atoms worth the $8.3 
          BILLION cost?!!  Don't we have much more important uses for 
          this WASTED money?! 
    
     
               Another thing to consider is that the primary proposed 
          location in Texas has a serious and growing problem with some 
          kind of "fire ants" eating the insulation off underground 
          cables.  How much POISONING of the ground and ground water 
          with insecticides will be required to keep the ants out of 
          the "Supercollider"?! 
    
          
               Naming the "Super Collider" after Ronald Reagon, as 
          proposed, is TOTALLY ABSURD!  If it is built, it should be 
          named after a leading particle PHYSICIST. 
      


          LARSONIAN Anti-Matter
          
               In Larson's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the 
          physical universe, anti-matter is NOT a simple case of 
          opposite charges of the same types of particles.  It has more 
          to do with the rates of vibrations and rotations of the 
          photons of which they are made, in relation to the 
          vibrational and rotational equivalents of the speed of light, 
          which Larson calls "Unit Velocity" and the "Natural Datum". 
     
               In Larson's Theory, a positron is actually a particle of 
          MATTER, NOT anti-matter.  When a positron and electron meet, 
          the rotational vibrations (charges) and rotations of their 
          respective photons (of which they are made) neutralize each 
          other. 
      
               In Larson's Theory, the ANTI-MATTER half of the physical 
          universe has THREE dimensions of TIME, and ONLY ONE dimension 
          of space, and exists in a RECIPROCAL RELATIONSHIP to our 
          MATERIAL half. 
       


          LARSONIAN Relativity
          
               The perihelion point in the orbit of the planet Mercury 
          has been observed and precisely measured to ADVANCE at the 
          rate of 574 seconds of arc per century.  531 seconds of this 
          advance are attributed via calculations to gravitational 
          perturbations from the other planets (Venus, Earth, Jupiter, 
          etc.).  The remaining 43 seconds of arc are being used to 
          help "prove" Einstein's "General Theory of Relativity". 
    
               But the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson achieved results 
          CLOSER to the 43 seconds than "General Relativity" can, by 
          INSTEAD using "SPECIAL Relativity".  In one or more of his 
          books, he applied the LORENTZ TRANSFORMATION on the HIGH 
          ORBITAL SPEED of Mercury. 
    
               Larson TOTALLY REJECTED "General Relativity" as another 
          MATHEMATICAL FANTASY.  He also REJECTED most of "Special 
          Relativity", including the parts about "mass increases" near 
          the speed of light, and the use of the Lorentz Transform on 
          doppler shifts, (Those quasars with red-shifts greater than 
          1.000 REALLY ARE MOVING FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT, 
          although most of that motion is away from us IN TIME.). 
     
               In Larson's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the 
          physical universe, there are THREE dimensions of time instead 
          of only one.  But two of those dimensions can NOT be measured 
          from our material half of the physical universe.  The one 
          dimension that we CAN measure is the CLOCK time.  At low 
          relative speeds, the values of the other two dimensions are 
          NEGLIGIBLE; but at high speeds, they become significant, and 
          the Lorentz Transformation must be used as a FUDGE FACTOR. 
          [Larson often used the term "COORDINATE TIME" when writing 
          about this.] 
    
     
               In regard to "mass increases", it has been PROVEN in 
          atomic accelerators that acceleration drops toward zero near 
          the speed of light.  But the formula for acceleration is 
          ACCELERATION = FORCE / MASS, (a = F/m).  Orthodox physicists 
          are IGNORING the THIRD FACTOR: FORCE.  In Larson's Theory, 
          mass STAYS CONSTANT and FORCE drops toward zero.  FORCE is 
          actually a MOTION, or COMBINATIONS of MOTIONS, or RELATIONS 
          BETWEEN MOTIONS, including INward and OUTward SCALAR MOTIONS.  
          The expansion of the universe, for example, is an OUTward 
          SCALAR motion inherent in the universe and NOT a result of 
          the so-called "Big Bang" (which is yet another MATHEMATICAL 
          FANTASY). 
    
                                    
          
          THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION

               I wish to recommend to EVERYONE the book "THE UNIVERSE 
          OF MOTION", by Dewey B. Larson, 1984, North Pacific 
          Publishers, (P.O. Box 13255, Portland, Oregon  97213), 456 
          pages, indexed, hardcover. 
    
               It contains the Astrophysical portions of a GENERAL 
          UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by that 
          author, an UNrecognized GENIUS, more than thirty years ago. 
    
               It contains FINAL SOLUTIONS to most ALL Astrophysical 
          mysteries, including the FORMATION of galaxies, binary and 
          multiple star systems, and solar systems, the TRUE ORIGIN of 
          the "3-degree" background radiation, cosmic rays, and gamma-
          ray bursts, and the TRUE NATURE of quasars, pulsars, white 
          dwarfs, exploding galaxies, etc.. 
    
               It contains what astronomers and astrophysicists are ALL 
          looking for, if they are ready to seriously consider it with 
          OPEN MINDS! 
    
               The following is an example of his Theory's success: 
          In his first book in 1959, "THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL 
          UNIVERSE", Larson predicted the existence of EXPLODING 
          GALAXIES, several years BEFORE astronomers started finding 
          them.  They are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of Larson's 
          comprehensive Theory.  And when QUASARS were discovered, he 
          had an immediate related explanation for them also. 
    

 
          GAMMA-RAY BURSTS

               Astro-physicists and astronomers are still scratching 
          their heads about the mysterious GAMMA-RAY BURSTS.  They were 
          originally thought to originate from "neutron stars" in the 
          disc of our galaxy.  But the new Gamma Ray Telescope now in 
          Earth orbit has been detecting them in all directions 
          uniformly, and their source locations in space do NOT 
          correspond to any known objects, (except for a few cases of 
          directional coincidence). 
    
               Gamma-ray bursts are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of the 
          GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by 
          the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson.  According to page 386 of 
          his book "THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION", published in 1984, the 
          gamma-ray bursts are coming from SUPERNOVA EXPLOSIONS in the 
          ANTI-MATTER HALF of the physical universe, which Larson calls 
          the "Cosmic Sector".  Because of the relationship between the 
          anti-matter and material halves of the physical universe, and 
          the way they are connected together, the gamma-ray bursts can 
          pop into our material half anywhere in space, seemingly at 
          random.  (This is WHY the source locations of the bursts do 
          not correspond with known objects, and come from all 
          directions uniformly.) 
    
               I wonder how close to us in space a source location 
          would have to be for a gamma-ray burst to kill all or most 
          life on Earth!  There would be NO WAY to predict one, NOR to 
          stop it! 
    
               Perhaps some of the MASS EXTINCTIONS of the past, which 
          are now being blamed on impacts of comets and asteroids, were 
          actually caused by nearby GAMMA-RAY BURSTS! 
    


          LARSONIAN Binary Star Formation
          
               About half of all the stars in the galaxy in the 
          vicinity of the sun are binary or double.  But orthodox 
          astronomers and astrophysicists still have no satisfactory 
          theory about how they form or why there are so many of them. 
    
               But binary star systems are actually a LIKELY 
          CONSEQUENCE of the comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of 
          the physical universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey 
          B. Larson. 
    
               I will try to summarize Larsons explanation, which is 
          detailed in Chapter 7 of his book "THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION" 
          and in some of his other books. 
    
               First of all, according to Larson, stars do NOT generate 
          energy by "fusion".  A small fraction comes from slow 
          gravitational collapse.  The rest results from the COMPLETE 
          ANNIHILATION of HEAVY elements (heavier than IRON).  Each 
          element has a DESTRUCTIVE TEMPERATURE LIMIT.  The heavier the 
          element is, the lower is this limit.  A star's internal 
          temperature increases as it grows in mass via accretion and 
          absorption of the decay products of cosmic rays, gradually 
          reaching the destructive temperature limit of lighter and 
          lighter elements. 
    
               When the internal temperature of the star reaches the 
          destructive temperature limit of IRON, there is a Type I 
          SUPERNOVA EXPLOSION!  This is because there is SO MUCH iron 
          present; and that is related to the structure of iron atoms 
          and the atom building process, which Larson explains in some 
          of his books [better than I can]. 
    
               When the star explodes, the lighter material on the 
          outer portion of the star is blown outward in space at less 
          than the speed of light.  The heavier material in the center 
          portion of the star was already bouncing around at close to 
          the speed of light, because of the high temperature.  The 
          explosion pushes that material OVER the speed of light, and 
          it expands OUTWARD IN TIME, which is equivalent to INWARD IN 
          SPACE, and it often actually DISAPPEARS for a while. 
    
               Over long periods of time, both masses start to fall 
          back gravitationally.  The material that had been blown 
          outward in space now starts to form a RED GIANT star.  The 
          material that had been blown OUTWARD IN TIME starts to form a 
          WHITE DWARF star.  BOTH stars then start moving back toward 
          the "MAIN SEQUENCE" from opposite directions on the H-R 
          Diagram. 
    
               The chances of the two masses falling back into the 
          exact same location in space, making a single lone star 
          again, are near zero.  They will instead form a BINARY 
          system, orbiting each other. 
     
               According to Larson, a white dwarf star has an INVERSE 
          DENSITY GRADIENT (is densest at its SURFACE), because the 
          material at its center is most widely dispersed (blown 
          outward) in time.   This ELIMINATES the need to resort to 
          MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES about "degenerate matter", "neutron 
          stars", "black holes", etc.. 
    


          LARSONIAN Solar System Formation

               If the mass of the heavy material at the center of the 
          exploding star is relatively SMALL, then, instead of a single 
          white dwarf star, there will be SEVERAL "mini" white dwarf 
          stars (revolving around the red giant star, but probably 
          still too far away in three-dimensional TIME to be affected 
          by its heat, etc.).  These will become PLANETS! 
      
               In Chapter 7 of THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION, Larson used all 
          this information, and other principles of his comprehensive 
          GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, to derive 
          his own version of Bode's Law. 
          


          "Black Hole" FANTASY!

               I heard that physicist Stephen W. Hawking recently 
          completed a theoretical mathematical analysis of TWO "black 
          holes" merging together into a SINGLE "black hole", and 
          concluded that the new "black hole" would have MORE MASS than 
          the sum of the two original "black holes". 
    
               Such a result should be recognized by EVERYone as a RED 
          FLAG, causing widespread DOUBT about the whole IDEA of "black 
          holes", etc.! 
    
               After reading Physicist Dewey B. Larson's books about 
          his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical 
          universe, especially his book "THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION", it is 
          clear to me that "black holes" are NOTHING more than 
          MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES!  The strange object at Cygnus X-1 is 
          just an unusually massive WHITE DWARF STAR, NOT the "black 
          hole" that orthodox astronomers and physicists so badly want 
          to "prove" their theory. 
    
    
               By the way, I do NOT understand why so much publicity is 
          being given to physicist Stephen Hawking.  The physicists and 
          astronomers seem to be acting as if Hawking's severe physical 
          problem somehow makes him "wiser".  It does NOT! 
    
               I wish the same attention had been given to Physicist 
          Dewey B. Larson while he was still alive.  Widespread 
          publicity and attention should NOW be given to Larson's 
          Theory, books, and organization (The International Society of 
          Unified Science). 
          
          
          
          ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PROPULSION

               I heard of that concept many years ago, in connection 
          with UFO's and unorthodox inventors, but I never was able to 
          find out how or why they work, or how they are constructed. 
    
               I found a possible clue about why they might work on 
          pages 112-113 of the book "BASIC PROPERTIES OF MATTER", by 
          the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson, which describes part of 
          Larson's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical 
          universe.  I quote one paragraph: 
    
               "As indicated in the preceding chapter, the development 
          of the theory of the universe of motion arrives at a totally 
          different concept of the nature of electrical resistance.  
          The electrons, we find, are derived from the environment.  It 
          was brought out in Volume I [Larson's book "NOTHING BUT 
          MOTION"] that there are physical processes in operation which 
          produce electrons in substantial quantities, and that, 
          although the motions that constitute these electrons are, in 
          many cases, absorbed by atomic structures, the opportunities 
          for utilizing this type of motion in such structures are 
          limited.  It follows that there is always a large excess of 
          free electrons in the material sector [material half] of the 
          universe, most of which are uncharged.  In this uncharged 
          state the electrons cannot move with respect to extension 
          space, because they are inherently rotating units of space, 
          and the relation of space to space is not motion.  In open 
          space, therefore, each uncharged electron remains permanently 
          in the same location with respect to the natural reference 
          system, in the manner of a photon.  In the context of the 
          stationary spatial reference system the uncharged electron, 
          like the photon, is carried outward at the speed of light by 
          the progression of the natural reference system.  All 
          material aggregates are thus exposed to a flux of electrons 
          similar to the continual bombardment by photons of radiation.  
          Meanwhile there are other processes, to be discussed later, 
          whereby electrons are returned to the environment.  The 
          electron population of a material aggregate such as the earth 
          therefore stabilizes at an equilibrium level." 
          
               Note that in Larson's Theory, UNcharged electrons are 
          also massLESS, and are basically photons of light of a 
          particular frequency (above the "unit" frequency) spinning 
          around one axis at a particular rate (below the "unit" rate).  
          ("Unit velocity" is the speed of light, and there are 
          vibrational and rotational equivalents to the speed of light, 
          according to Larson's Theory.)  [I might have the "above" and 
          "below" labels mixed up.] 
    
               Larson is saying that outer space is filled with mass-
          LESS UN-charged electrons flying around at the speed of 
          light! 
    
               If this is true, then the ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PROPULSION 
          fields of spacecraft might be able to interact with these 
          electrons, or other particles in space, perhaps GIVING them a 
          charge (and mass) and shooting them toward the rear to 
          achieve propulsion. (In Larson's Theory, an electrical charge 
          is a one-dimensional rotational vibration of a particular 
          frequency (above the "unit" frequency) superimposed on the 
          rotation of the particle.) 
      
               The paragraph quoted above might also give a clue to 
          confused meteorologists about how and why lightning is 
          generated in clouds. 



          SUPPRESSION of LARSONIAN Physics

               The comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical 
          universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson has 
          been available for more than 30 YEARS, published in 1959 in 
          his first book "THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL UNIVERSE". 
    
               It is TOTALLY UN-SCIENTIFIC for Hawking, Wheeler, Sagan, 
          and the other SACRED PRIESTS of the RELIGION they call 
          "science" (or "physics", or "astronomy", etc.), as well as 
          the "scientific" literature and the "education" systems, to 
          TOTALLY IGNORE Larson's Theory has they have. 
    
               Larson's Theory has excellent explanations for many 
          things now puzzling orthodox physicists and astronomers, such 
          as gamma-ray bursts and the nature of quasars. 
    
               Larson's Theory deserves to be HONESTLY and OPENLY 
          discussed in the physics, chemistry, and astronomy journals, 
          in the U.S. and elsewhere.  And at least the basic principles 
          of Larson's Theory should be included in all related courses 
          at UW-EC, UW-Madison, Cambridge, Cornell University, and 
          elsewhere, so that students are not kept in the dark about a 
          worthy alternative to the DOGMA they are being fed. 
    
          

               For more information, answers to your questions, etc., 
          please consult my CITED SOURCES (especially Larson's BOOKS). 



               UN-altered REPRODUCTION and DISSEMINATION of this 
          IMPORTANT partial summary is ENCOURAGED.

Drive down to Cincinnati and take a look.  Not pretty, is it?
Things were much better there in 1980.  All that growth went into
the hands of Ron and Georgie's pals, and I DIDN'T GET A SINGLE

I wonder how many American-owned companies employ those in
Central Ohio?  Other than Ohio State University.  :)

They are one of the largest manufacturers of IC packaging in the

It sounds like you would be a good candidate for wafer probing or at
least IC probing to test performance.  HP, Cascade Microtech and
Tektronix should be able to help you here.  One note, testing at high

 If a large Malmute counts then yes someone has heard(and seen) such
an irresponsible childish stunt. The dog needed assistance straightening
out once on board. The owner would lift the front legs of dog and throw
them over the driver/pilots shoulders. Said dog would get shit eating

on the seat.
 
 My dog and this dog actively seek each other out at camping party's.
They hate each other. I think it's something personal.

Yes, but in a fairly reproducible way. -40 is only a smidgen of the
distance to absolute zero. And in any case you're going to have to
borrow freezer space from a bio lab or someone to test/calibrate this
darling anyway. Btw, you're probably going to want those big capacitors
you found to fire the solenoid -- High current drain on frozen batteries
can be an ugly thing.

If Comet Shoemaker-Levy 1993e is in Jovian orbit, and if the comet
is still hanging around when Galileo arrives, then I'm sure it will
be added to the list of targets.  We'll have by then over two years
of Earth-based observations to help narrow down the positions of the
pieces of the comet. It probably won't be too much different than
what was done with Gaspra.

Galileo did not image Toutatis.  That came from Earth-based radar.

My first thought is Ross Perot.  After further consideration, I think he'd

  There was an interesting article in Scientific American some time ago
about breathing liquid. (It was a few months before _The Abyss_ came out.)
As far as I can remember, they mentioned three things that were difficult
to do at once with a substitute breathing fluid:
  - low viscosity --- if it's too difficult to force the fluid in & out 
    of the lungs, you can't extract enough oxygen to power your own
    breathing effort (let alone anything else)

  - diffusion rate --- obviously, not all the air in your lungs is
    expelled when you breathe out; and the part that isn't expelled
    is the part that's nearest the walls of the alveoli. (alveolus?)
    So the trip from the blood vessels to the new air has to be done
    by diffusion of the gas through the fluid. Apparently oxygen
    tends to diffuse more readily than CO2, so even if you can get enough
    oxygen in, you might not be able to get enough CO2 out.

  - oxygen/CO2 capacity --- you have to be able to dissolve enough
    gas per unit volume. 

  Oh, and of course, your new breathing fluid must not irritate the lungs
or interfere with their healing or anything like that...

Careful now folks... Also consider the 90VAC+ @20Hz that is forced on ring
and tip when the phone's supposed to ring!  Even with a simple zener
and LED setup, you might end up with some carbon real quick.  Whatever
scheme you use, make sure you've got at least 200V-rated components on 
the frontend.

Also remember that, if I'm not mistaken, the phone line is a 600ohm
equivalent circuit.  Any current you draw from the 48V or so gets
dropped across that 600ohms.  That's fine until you're down to roughly
12V, when Ma Bell considers it to be off-hook.  But dropping it that
far down is probably a big no-no.

The easiest implementation to accomplish the above??

This is only a suggestion...go ahead and blow holes in it, but you
get the idea.  Choose a high-efficiency LED so you don't need much
current to get it to light up.  Choose values for the other components
as required.

I've seen solar battery boosters, and they seem to come without any
guarantee. On the other hand, I've heard that some people use them
with success, although I have yet to communicate directly with such a
person. Have you tried one? What was your experience? How did you use
it (occasional charging, long-term leave-it-for-weeks, etc.)?

I responded to Jim's other articles today, but I see that I neglected
to respond to this one.  I wouldn't want him to think me a hypocrite
for not responding to *every* stupid article on t.r.m.

Oh, but I'm weary of trying to wade through Jim's repertoire of 
red herrings and smoke screens.

Let's see what we get when we run all four articles posted by Jim today
through the 'discord' filter (a Markov chain program that Steve Lamont
was kind enough to send me):

	Taking action? A white geese be held
	as an accomplice to be held as
	a decision upon the door
	A black and white goose waddles past
	the eyes of the door. 
	Hits it with the confidence interval for

	for that, that individual 
	may be held as a 
	getaway car may be held 
	as an uncountably large number 
	of the driver of something 
	and agree.

	A black goose 
	waddles past the person imprisoned?

	White goose waddles past the 
	confidence interval for the population 
	of geese be axed, 
	fine.
	And white goose 
	waddles past the door.

Does running Jim's articles through 'discord' make them more
coherent?  Less coherent?

Or has 'discord' turned Jim's articles into an angst-ridden poem
about making choices in a world filled with uncertainty, yet being
held responsible for the choices we make?  Do the geese symbolize
an inner frustration with ambiguity, a desire that everything be
black and white, with no shades of gray?  Does the "getaway car"
tell us that to try to renounce the existential nature of our
being is not to "get away" from responsibility for our actions,
but rather to take the role of the passive accomplice, the
"driver" of the getaway car, as it were?  Does the juxtaposition
of man and machine, car and driver, reveal a subtext: an internal
conflict between determinism and moral responsibility?

Or am I reading too much into a collaboration between Jim and
a random number generator?

What do you mean by "police band" - there is no such thing.

Anyway, radar detectors work in shared bands.
If you applied your test, all of those radar operated door
openers in malls would be illegal.

One of the great problems here is that there are too many
ill-educated (read illiterate) people making too many laws
about subjects on which they are incompetent - there may well
be laws refereing to "police bands", they are almost certainly
local in scope (state or county) - created by well-meaning,
but incompetent idiots.

Unfortunaltely, laws do not have to be sensible (or even enforceable).
Lawmakers exist to pass laws - and will continue to do so, until
the day where you are faced with death for not doing X, and
amputation of all your limbs for doing X ... the choice will be yours.

Yes, that is most certainly true. However, the paragrapgh reflects a value-less
position and infers that what is more important than anything else is to
have "a positive view" of one's self.

This of course, is foolish.

Should a mass murderer, a pedophile, a 10-year old pyromaniac have a "positive
view" of themselves?

Of course not.

A person that engages in behaviour that a large number of people condemn,
and IF you believe in the concept of "society", then your only choice is
to expect that person to have a negative view of themselves.

There is a number you can call which will return a synthesized
voice telling you the number of the line.  Unfortunately, for the
life of me I can't remember what it is. The telephone technicians
use it all the time.  We used to play around with this in our

Dear Rob,

>the truth.  When I read your response here, I see condescension.  When you
>reply to a post, reply to the post you quote.  This statement undermines
>any good points you might have had (it was enough to make me stop reading).

Sometimes I do come across condesending, and I am sorry I come across that
way at times.  Thank you for the reproach, I really do appreciate it.  I'll
try to get better.

Rob, at the same time, I have also learned that some people respond to the gentle
approach while others respond only at a harsh rebuke.  Brian K., so far,
only responds to the latter.  And I am glad he responds at all.   In both
cases of approach,  my intention is to be loving.  I am making no excuse
for myself if I am coming across condesending.  I apologize for that.

Rob, sometimes Brian K. comes across as honest. I know this.  But Brian K. 
vasillates back and forth.  One post looks honest; the next is
an excuse.  Now he wants me to explain the universe in 50 words or less.  
I think Brian Kendig is really trying but he is too comfortable with
his set of excuses.  

I just want Brian K. to be honest with himself.  If he really wants
to know, he will ask questions and stop asserting irrelevant excuses
which have nothing to do with my God.   I wish Brian would read the
Bible for himself and come to his own decisions without being
sidetracked with the temptation to mock God.

From my perspective Rob, when I look at Brian Kendig, I see a man
standing out in the middle of a highway.  Off into the distance I 
see a Mack truck heading right for him, but Brian K. is faced away
from the oncoming truck.  He doesn't see it.   Here's is how I see
the dialog:


Me:  "Brian K, please step aside before you get run over." 

BK:  "There is no truck."

Me:  "Turn around at look."

BK:  "No."

Me:  "Look!  You will be healthier if you do take a look at
     the oncoming truck."

BK:  "No. Explain to me why trucks exist."

Me:  "Turn around or you will run over."

BK:  "No. I won't because I like hiking and tomorrow is Tuesday."

Me:  "You blind fool!  Why do you choose ignorance? You have nothing
      to lose if you look.  But if do not look, you will certainly lose your life."
      I do not want to see you squashed all over the road.

BK:  "It is my life to lose.  I rather not look.
      Besides, a truck running over me will not harm me."
      And by the way, I really have an open mind."


So is my motivation to belittle Brian, or to love Brian the best I know how?   

I do not wish to single Brian Kendig out.  Because millions if not
billions of people fall into the same category.  Perhaps all people
fall have fallen into this category at one time in their lives.  I have.
I can now see the truck behind Brian.

My hope is that Brian will look and will see the ramifications of the
truck coming towards him.  My hope is that Brian will want to step out
of the way.  My fear, though,  is that Brian will instead choose to glue himself
to the middle of the highway, where he will certainly get run over.  But if
he so chooses, he so chooses, and there is nothing I can do beyond that
to change his mind.   For it is his choice.   But at this very moment,
Brian hasn't gotten even that far.  He is still at the point where he
does not want to look.  Sure he moves his eyeball to appease me, but his
head will not turn around to see the entire picture.  So far he is
satisfied with his glimpse of the mountains off in the distance. 

Thank you again Rob for your reproach.  I really do appreciate it.  (My
wife tells me the same thing at times.)   :-)   I will try to do better.

While shopping for a passenger helmet, I noticed that in many cases the
external dimensions of the helmets were the same from S through XL.  The
difference was the amount of inside padding.

My solution was to buy a large helmet, and construct a removable liner 
from a sheet of .5" closed-cell foam and some satin (glued to the inside
surface).  The result is a reasonably snug fit on my smallest-headed pillion
with the liner in, and a comfortable fit on my largest-headed pillion with
the liner out.  Everyone else gets linered or not by best fit.

I'm sorry about your friend.  Really.  But this anecdote does nothing to
justify the "war on drugs".  If anything, it demonstrates that the "war"
is a miserable failure.  What it demonstrates is that people will take
drugs if they want to, legal or not.  Perhaps if your friend were taking
legal, regulated drugs under a doctors supervision he might not be in the
position he's in now.

Hello,

I just canceled my support of the Cable Regime and I would like to at
least pick up the 3 networks and NBC.  :)   I do not have tons of
money nor even a few pounds so what I am looking for is the best solution
for reception for under 100 dollars.  I have seen modules that you plug
into your wall outlet that "supposedly" make your entire house an
antenna.  I have to admit, even with my limited knowledge of wavelength
and aerial reception, this seems dubious in its claims for "excellent
reception" at best.  I'll try anything, though, if it WORKS.  I am in

It is a bit unfair to call blame the Clinton Administration alone...this
initiative was underway under the Bush Administration...it is basically
a bipartisan effort of the establishment Demopublicans and
Republicrats...the same bipartisan effort that brought the S&L scandal,
and BCCI, etc.

Call a friend long distance, collect.  Ask to speak with yourself.  When
the operator asks for you, you won't be there, so ask the operator to leave
your number.  She'll read it out in the clear.

On my 59 sporty I had some pinhole leaks open up on the back seam.  I kreme

Forwarded from John Spencer (spencer@lowell.edu):

There will be two eclipses of Iapetus by Saturn and its
rings, in May and July.  Please spread the word!  Here's some
information about the events, and then a couple of messages from Jay
Goguen of JPL appealing for thermal observations of the eclipse to
learn more about the thermal properties of Iapetus.  He might also have
some money available...

John Spencer, 1993/04/21

Iapetus will be eclipsed by the shadows of Saturn's rings and Saturn
itself on 1993/05/01-02 (18:27-13:43 UT) and again on 1993/07/20-21,
(21:16-09:38 UT).  Timing is as follows;

     1993 May 1-2

        A-ring ingress  18:27
               egress   19:30
        B-ring ingress  19:51
               egress   21:42
        C-ring egress   23:00
        Saturn ingress  23:59
               egress   10:02
        B-ring ingress  10:28
               egress   12:19
        A-ring ingress  12:40
               egress   13:43

     1993 July 20-21

        Saturn ingress  21:16
               egress   05:08
        A-ring ingress  05:13  (grazing)
               egress   09:38

Times could be 30 minutes later according to an alternate ephemeris,
and photometric observations are important for refining Iapetus'
orbit.  Because the Sun's size projected on the rings as seen from
Iapetus is 3100 km it's unlikely that we will learn anything new about
the rings themselves from the observations.  See Soma (1992), Astronomy
and Astrophysics 265, L21-L24 for more details.  Thanks to Andy Odell
of Northern Arizona University for bringing the events to my
attention.

THERMAL OBSERVATIONS?

Jay Goguen (jdg@scn5.Jpl.Nasa.Gov) writes:

  To me, the interesting thing to do would be thermal IR of the 20 July
  disappearance into the shadow of the planet to measure thermal inertia,
  etc.  Unfortunately, the 21:30 UT of this event renders it inaccessible,
  except from Russia.  Even from Calar Alto, Saturn is rising through 3
  airmasses at 23:00 UT.  Do you know anyone in Russia or Ukraine with
  a big telescope and 10 um instrumentation that's looking for something
  to do?  I'd be willing to make a personal grant of >$100 for the data.

  Jay

and again:

  please try to encourage anyone that can observe the iapetus planet
  disappearance to do so at thermal wavelengths.  My impression would
  be that it's not an easy observation.  Iapetus will be faint and
  getting fainter in eclipse, so you'll need a big telescope that's a
  good IR telescope and reasonable 10 - 20 um instrumentation.  I don't
  think that combination is widely available at the longitudes that are
  well placed for observation.  We need SOFIA for this one.  One
  possibility would be the IR telescope in India, but it's only a 1.2 m.

I have heard that the sabbath was originally determined by the phases of
the moon, and had elements of moon worship.  Early stuff, Egyptian in nature.

I used a bunch as weights, when building a model airplane.  Hung them

CONTACTING NASA, ESA, AND OTHER SPACE AGENCIES/COMPANIES

Many space activities center around large Government or International
Bureaucracies.	In the US that means NASA.  If you have basic information
requests: (e.g., general PR info, research grants, data, limited tours, and
ESPECIALLY SUMMER EMPLOYMENT (typically resumes should be ready by Jan.  1),
etc.), consider contacting the nearest NASA Center to answer your questions.

EMail typically will not get you any where, computers are used by
investigators, not PR people. The typical volume of mail per Center is a
multiple of 10,000 letters a day. Seek the Public Information Office at one
of the below, this is their job:

NASA (The National Aeronautics and Space Administration) is the
civilian space agency of of the United States Federal Government.
It reports directly to the White House and is not a Cabinet
post such as the military Department of Defense.  Its 20K+ employees
are civil servants and hence US citizens.  Another 100K+ contractors
also work for NASA.

  The commercial uses of a transportation system between already-settled-
and-civilized areas are obvious.  Spaceflight is NOT in this position.
The correct analogy is not with aviation of the '30's, but the long
transocean voyages of the Age of Discovery.  It didn't require gov't to
fund these as long as something was known about the potential for profit
at the destination.  In practice, some were gov't funded, some were private.
But there was no way that any wise investor would spend a large amount
of money on a very risky investment with no idea of the possible payoff.
  I am sure that a thriving spaceflight industry will eventually develop,
and large numbers of people will live and work off-Earth.  But if you ask
me for specific justifications other than the increased resource base, I
can't give them.  We just don't know enough.  The launch rate demanded by
existing space industries is just too low to bring costs down much, and
we are very much in the dark about what the revolutionary new space industries
will be, when they will practical, how much will have to be invested to
start them, etc.

Agreed.

It is a failure of libertarianism if the ideology does not provide any
reasonable way to restrain such actions other than utopian dreams.  Just
as Marxism "fails" to specify how pure communism is to be achieved and
the state is to "wither away," libertarians frequently fail to show how
weakening the power of the state will result in improvement in the human
condition.

This is a strawman argument and fails on several grounds.  In this case,
"limited" and "big" government are not defined.  I would point out that
Lebanon, Somalia, and the former Yugoslavia are by some definitions nations
with "limited" government, while the US, Canada, and nations in Western 
Europe (where "people would rather live") are often pointed out as 
nations with "big government" from a libertarian point of view.  

The argument is not between those who want "limited" government and those
who want "unlimited" government.  It is between those who believe
government regulation in a capitalist economy serves worthwhile ends and
those who believe such regulation is neither desirable on empirical 
grounds nor justifiable on ideological grounds.

I wouldn't worry about it.  There's enough space debris up there that
a mile-long inflatable would probably deflate in some very short
period of time (less than a year) while cleaning up LEO somewhat.
Sort of a giant fly-paper in orbit.

Hmm, that could actually be useful.

As for advertising -- sure, why not?  A NASA friend and I spent one
drunken night figuring out just exactly how much gold mylar we'd need
to put the golden arches of a certain American fast food organization
on the face of the Moon.  Fortunately, we sobered up in the morning.

 since 9pm.  It's now 6am... I'm pissed off.  Period.  Alright, I can
 drive the steppers through the 3479P's; no problem (that's with the
 6-wire steppers, 2 to +, and the other 4 are the phase lines).  Problem
 1:  I've got some 4 wire steppers.  I put the darkest line to + and the
 other 3 to the 3479P... worked, kinda.  Tried it with a printer stepper
 (moves the head back and forth, 4 wires), didn't work too well.  It 
would
 shift back and forth (use something like a 4017 instead?)  Also I've 
been
 trying to get a bunch of NPN's to work with it... NO LUCK... tried 
PNP's,
 still NO LUCK!!!  I don't know if I'm cursed on this or what, but I feel
 my brain slowly frying with the thought of STEPPER ... ARGGG!!!
         I don't know what's wrong with the transistor hook-up (to-220 
pkg
 type), also tryed the 2n2222-pkg type... no luck.

                         I'm going to try getting some z's, and I hope 
you
 can help me with this problem.
   If someone can please help me with this soon, it would be greatly
   appreciated...

                 Thanks.

Either the government has force available to it, or it doesn't.  The
Libertarian position is that the government can use force only when someone
else uses force first -- even when that first force is not directed
against the government, but one of its citizens.  That all being true, 
what safeguards do we have against the government CLAIMING that some
initiation of force on its part is really a response?  (Like the burning
of the Maine, the Tonkin Gulf incident, or the assault on Waco?)

I ask this not to argue, but to understand.

As I heard the story, before Albert came up the the theory
o'relativity and warped space, nobody could account for
Mercury's orbit.  It ran a little fast (I think) for simple
Newtonian physics.  With the success in finding Neptune to
explain the odd movments of Uranus, it was postulated that there
might be another inner planet to explain Mercury's orbit.  

It's unlikely anything bigger than an asteroid is closer to the
sun than Mercury.  I'm sure we would have spotted it by now.
Perhaps some professionals can confirm that.

Most of the key issues in the 284 line post to which I am following up are
dealt with in the following post I made on talk.abortion yesterday,
modified to correct the next to last paragraph.

>See the "Spreading Christianity" thread, in which he says I

Dean did not.  He called them "the Great Commission" but this is NOT
descriptive of Jesus's words in Matt. 10:15.

Matt. 10:14, Jerusalem Bible translation:

	"And if anyone does not welcome you or listen to what you have
	to say, as you walk out of the house or town shake the dust
	from your feet."

Matt. 10:15:

 	"I tell you solemnly, on the day of Judgment it will not 
 	go as hard with the land of Sodom and Gomorrah as with 
 	that town."

In the post to which Dean is referring above, I said:

"> The above is a good description of Kaflowitz, who keeps harping on
 > shaking the dust off the feet but ignoring what Christ said next."
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^                                ^^^^

The highlighted words refer to Matt 10:14 and 10:15 respectively.

And Dean countered:

"Actually, this comment of your's is a perfect example of what an
intellectually dishonest little sparrowfart you are, since I
specifically acknowledged the Great Commission and the entreaty
to spread the word.  In fact, it is the combination of the two
statements I was addressing, and not just the one, and for you to
characterize that as "ignoring" the instruction to spread the
word is a good example of what a dishonest little fellow you are."

Of course, Matt 10:15 [quoted above] makes no mention of "instruction
to spread the word."

All these quotes btw are from:

Message-ID: <1993Apr13.121624.3400@cbnewsj.cb.att.com>

>in which, at the end, he claims I did not answer a question
>which I answered, and which he deleted (to get the chronology
>right, he deleted the answer and then said I didn't answer).

And I claim it correctly, because my question went:

"Do you, too, measure
the goodness of a post by its entertainment value, and care not
a whit for such mundane things as truth and falsehood?"

and the closest Dean came to an answer was:

"Peter, Peter, Peter.  You're just so stupid, pretentious, dull,
and generally unworthy of the value you place on yourself that
the sport is all there is."

Of course, this does NOT answer my question, which has to do with posts
in GENERAL and not my posts in particular.  Surely even Dean knows this,
yet he brazenly asserts otherwise, reinforcing his claim with an insult:

"So I now restore the answer to your question
that you deleted.  If you're still unable to figure it out, ask
a nice kid at the local junior high to help you.  It really
doesn't take much sophistication to understand."

On top of which, I doubt that the "answer" is at all representative
of Dean's true frame of mind.  The insults you have seen quoted thus
far are but a small sample of the stream that oozes out of Dean's 
mind throughout the 284-line post from which these quotes were taken.
One wonders whether Dean's mind is so warped as to find sport in all
this.

He even dredges up a falsified account of
events that transpired earlier on another thread:

"You made an ass of yourself by claiming that it
				^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
was in the tradition of Lent to make public announcements of
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
the "sins" of other individuals."
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

False.  I said it was the tradition to recall and atone for one's sins.
That I made public announcements of the "sins" of others
--"sins", BTW, that were a matter of public record, documented in
the posts of others-- is a different matter.

Many of the individuals involved are so nearly amoral that
they do not see as sins what morally upright people see as sins, so
I pointed some of them out.  And I expressly set up a whole thread,
YOUR TURN, to let people point out MY sins to me.

Dean again:

"You made an ass of yourself
by saying that my statement of the tradition of tzedukkah was
somehow an attempt to "paint Jews as plaster saints," thereby
revealing your inability to understand the discussion as well
as showing your dislike for people saying positive things
about Jews, and now you show your intellectual dishonesty by
repeatedly ignoring the simple argument being made, and then
claiming I am ignoring the very argument I acknowledge."

Actually, what happened was that Dean made it seem like ANY Jew
who gave alms or did other acts of charity in public was a hypocrite
according to Jewish customs.  In doing so, he was caricaturing
Jewish customs as being almost impossibly demanding, as well as
implicitly slandering all Jews who make public their acts of charity.

I went very easily on Dean for this, giving him the benefit of
the doubt in a post following my initial crack about "plaster saints", 
suggesting that he had been merely careless in his wording.

In an astonishing act of ingratitude, Dean now serves up an incredibly
distorted picture of what took place between us, and using it as
the basis of one insult after another.

Ouch. :-)   This brings to mind one of the recommendations in the
Hurt Study.   Because the rear of the gas tank is in close proximity
to highly prized and easily damaged anatomy, Hurt et al recommended
that manufacturers build the tank so as to reduce the, er, step function
provided when the rider's body slides off of the seat and onto the
gas tank in the unfortunate event that the bike stops suddenly and the 
rider doesn't.  I think it's really inspiring how the manufacturers
have taken this advice to heart in their design of bikes like the 
CBR900RR and the GTS1000A.

Intel also makes some neat memory and peripheral chips:

Old technology (early 1980's)  
8155  ram plus IO (slow ram as I recall)
8755  eprom plus IO (expensive and slow)


Intel does make Eproms with built in address latches.
I fear that you would need a very flexible and up-to-date eprom

give them a call.  I am not able to locate their memory products book

That sounds like an awfully closed minded, intolerant attitude.

1/2  :')     

I'm not a redneck but . . . try a walk in their shoes first.  Stereotypes
are usually of very limited value.  I've seen as many ignorant
self-righteous "open minded" new age lovers of the great planet Earth
as I have ignorant "red necks".  I don't see a correlation. I don't
believe that the "redneck" culture, if you can call it that, is
necessarily inferior or superior to any other.  

I gotta have a beer, I'm making too much sense.  Next thing you know,
I'll be preaching tolerance . . .. and I'm a conservative.

I agree, which is why I've asked for help with it.

The reason I'm working on this list is because I've recently had one
too many Christians tell me "the Bible contains no contradictions
whatsoever."  They believe that it's true, and that it describes
reality perfectly, and even predicts history before it happens.

Before I can carry on any sort of meaningful conversation with these
people, I've got to SHOW them, with concrete evidence, that the Bible
is not nearly as airtight as they thought.  I hope to do that with
this list.

Specifically: when I bring up the fact that Genesis contains two
contradictory creation stories, I usually get blank stares or flat
denials.  I've never had a fundamentalist acknowledge that there are
indeed two different accounts of creation.

Alan,

	don't forget,  a HUGE  cost for airliner developement is FAA
certification.  the joke is when the paperwork  exceeds teh weight
of the airplane,  it will fly.

The SR-71, and teh X-15  both highly ambitious  aero-space projects were done
on very narrow engineering budgets.   Partly because they didn't spend much
on paper  pushing.   There is some company in missouri  trying to
get funding to build light commercial transporters  on a low cost basis,
mostly by reducing FAA  certification costs.

RS Components (they exist in Australia and the UK. Don't know about the US) have
little chips called Isolated MAX 250 and 251. They give you isolated RS-232 from
a single 5V supply. External components are 4 caps, 4 optoisolators, a diode,
and an isloting transformer. They go up to 19.2K baud..

Your statement is a common misconception, but it just isn't true. In the
German Weimar system, the Chancellor was not necessarily the leader of the
largest Reichstag party; the Chancellor was appointed by the President and
generally was the leader of a coalition of parties who could form an effective
majority in the Reichstag. Beyond that, the implication that Hitler rose to
the Chancellorship because a majority of Germans wanted Nazi rule is false
as well. Before President Hindenburg appointed Hitler Chancellor in January
1933, the German people did not show a particular desire to be led either by
Hitler or by the Nazi party. These are the results of the March 1932 election
for President, the closest Hitler ever came to direct election: Hindenburg
49.6%, Hitler 30.1%, Thaelmann 13.2%, Duesterberg 6.8%. In the runoff election
in April the results were: Hindenburg 53%, Hitler 36.8%, Thaelmann 10.2%.
So we can see that Hitler personally was supported by only about a third of
German voters.

Similarly, the Nazi party never received more than 37% of the vote in
Reichstag elections. That occurred in July 1932. In the November 1932 election
the Nazis *lost* two million votes and 34 seats, down from 230 to 196 out of
the 608 in the Reichstag. Comparitively, the Socialists had 121 and the
Communists 100. The Communists had gained 11 seats, and the German National
party, which had supported the previous government, had picked up a million
of the Nazis' lost votes to gain 15 seats (up to 52). I think the other large
party was the Catholic Center party (I don't know how many seats they had but
I think they were declining), and there were numerous other small parties.
Thus the Nazi vote was on the decline at the time Hitler was appointed
Chancellor.

What brought Hitler to power was *not* the demand of the German people for
Hitler or the Nazis to run things, but the inability of the other parties to
put their differences behind them in favor of forming an effective government
for the country. Germany did not have an enduring democratic tradition, and
their parliamentary system lacked effective center parties that favored the
interests of the majority of the population. Instead what they had was a
number of small parties who were unable to put aside their own specific
objectives in order to combine against the Nazis, who were out to end the
democratic process. In fact, part of the problem was that some of the other
parties with substantial representation, like the Communists, were also
out to end the democratic process, but with different results in mind, and
generally didn't mind seeing parliamentary democracy go under.

Germany had already had a non-Nazi Chancellor with a majority coalition
for five months while the Nazis had been the largest Reichstag party, and
there certainly was no danger of a revolution in favor of the Nazis.
If anything the Nazis were starting to get desperate because they had failed
to get enough support to make Hitler President and their popular vote had
begun to decline.

Hitler was not Hindenburg's first choice to be Chancellor, not even his
second choice. First, von Papen had been Chancellor since June 1932. After
the November election when the Nazis *lost* seats, Hindenburg first prevailed
on von Papen to remain as Chancellor. But there were intrigues behind his back
and support for him was lacking. So then Hindenburg turned to von Schleicher,
who became Chancellor for two months. Eventually he too was unable to hold
together a working coalition of parties to oppose the Nazis, who refused to
participate in any government that was not led by a Nazi Chancellor. Some of
the Nazi leadership, particularly Gregor Strasser who was the #2 man in the
party at the time, wanted to participate in a coalition government. But others,
knowing the party's support was waning, figured that their best hope to gain
power lay in undermining the democratic process. Nevertheless, the country
was governed for seven months by Chancellors who were not Nazis, even though
the Nazis were the largest Reichstag party. The failure of these men to
achieve a working coalition was due to the inability of their coalition
parties to work together.

Here's how William Shirer puts it in _The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich_:

   The cardinal error of the Germans who opposed Nazism was their
   failure to unite against it. At the crest of their popular strength,
   in July 1932, the National Socialists had attained but 37 percent of
   the vote. But the 63 percent of the German people who expressed their
   opposition to Hitler were much too divided and shortsighted to combine
   against a common danger which they must have known would overwhelm
   them unless they united, however temporarily, to stamp it out.

True, the German people supported Hitler after he became Chancellor. But
that doesn't change the fact that there was not overwhelming support for him
*before* he was in power. The German people were not crying out for Hitler to
take over, no matter how bad economic conditions were. The leftist parties
(Socialists/Communists) probably had more support in total than the Nazis.
Hitler used the fact that others were passively or actively willing to see
the government paralyzed as a means to taking it over.

Thanks for the resposes as they were all good ideas and I am looking at using a
couple of the ideas. I recieved in the mail today the spec sheets on the mil.
spec version of Exar's XR-2240 timer/counter chip. It is stable down to -50 C
and sucks very little power. They show an application for a ultra-long time
delay (up to several years depending on the RC time constant). In this
application, they have two of them cascaded together. The reset and trigger
pins of both chips are tied together and the timebase of the second chip is
disabled. In this configuration, the output is high when the system is reset.
When triggered, the output goes low and stays that way for a total of 65,536 x
the timing cycle of the first chip. The total timing cycle of the two chips can
be programmed from To = 256 x R x C to 65,536 x R x C in 256 steps by selecting
any combination of the counter outputs to the timer output. The beauty of it
is, the timebase chip would only have to have a 100uF timing cap and a 391K
resistor for 39.1 seconds per timing cycle. So I can get a maximum of
2,562,457.6 seconds between timing cycles (39.1 x 65,536 or about 29 days !)
Of course, that's much more than I need (14 days). But the counter allows for
256 binary steps that can be selected for the output for the 'pellet puker'.
After the first 14 days and it trips, it would reset its self for the next 14
day timing cycle and so forth.

Power is still a problem though. A few ideas that you suggested was to bury the
electronics in a hole dug in the snow (as an insulator) and put the pellet
puker up on a tower above the estimated snow fall with a solar panel on it to
keep a charge on a lithium battery pack. I like that idea ;-) This thing has to
work for at least six weeks for three samples and the gas valves are 12 volts
to spit the pellets out onto the snow. Anyway, I ordered the XR-2240's to see
what I can do with them. Should be interesting (as long as I'm not the one that
has to go digging up the pellets in the middle of Antartica freezing my buns
off ;-)

Thanks again everyone...

It sound like to me that your carbs are not jetted properly.
If you did it yourself, take it to a shop and get it done right.
If a shop did it, get your money back, and go to another shop.

	In the hopes of adding a little life to, what seems to be, the
same old debates, I would like to add a few bits of info and ask for
comments.

1) A couple days ago the headlines were splashed with stories of proof
   that the North Vietnamese had held U.S. hostages after the war ended.
	Way back in today's newspaper (Page A7 of San Francisco Chronicle)
   there is an article about the document that held the proof.
	[used without permission]

	"The document, which was discovered in the archives of the Soviet
    Communist Party in Moscow, is a Russian translation of what is described
    as a September 1972 report prepared for the Vietnam Politburo by General
    Tran Van Quang, who is identified as the deputy chief of staff of the
    North Vietnamese army."
         [later on in the article after it talks about the claim of 1,205
           Americans in North Vietnamese prisons]
	"Phong said the easiest way to prove that the document is a 
    fabrication is to review Quang's career. In 1972, he said, Quang was 
    not deputy chief of staff; he was the army commander in Military Region 4
    in central Vietnam."

2) I heard on the radio that the Church of Scientology has filed for 
   bankrupcy becuase the employees of Cocolat , owned by CoS, filed a 
   class action suit against them for requiring the employees to pay dues
   to become members of the Church. Anyone heard more about this?

3) Micheal Jackson went into business with Micheal Milken. No lie.

I'd recommend that you hop on the back of it and cruise - that's a
really nice ride, if you choose your route with any care at all.
Shouldn't cost more than about $30 in gas, and maybe a night's motel
bill...

Dean, there's an old engineering saying concerning inventions and

Black and white.  A spade is a spade.  There is no hidden
agenda behind this, so stop trying to look for one.   It is an
easy and as straight forward as it reads.

Kent, I am not accusing you of evil things.  Jesus is accusing you.
And it is not only you that He is accusing.  He is accusing everyone.
Me, you and everyone in the world is guilty.  Whether one
sees the light or does not seen the light has nothing to do with 
whether we do evil things.  We do them regardless.  

Jesus uses the word "men".  I am included.  Jesus is not soloing you out.
Jesus is making a general statement about out the sad state of man.
Christians are not immuned from doing evil things.  A Christian 
is just a person in whom the Holy Spirit indwells.  A Christian 
can see the evil he is doing--because his evil has been brought
out into the light.  Jesus is not saying that just because evil has been
exposed, that the Christian will stop doing evil.  If you haven't
seen Jesus's light, your evil deeds simply haven't been
exposed to the His light.  You may shed some light on your
own.  Your human spirit shines at perhaps 1 candela.  But the
Holy Spirit shines at a Megacandela.  The Holy Spirit can
shine light into places inside us where we didn't even know
existed. 

So do you see Jesus's point?  Christians are not perfect.  Nonchristians
are not perfect.  Nonchristians do not want to come into the
Light of Jesus because they will see all the problems in their lives,
and they will not like the sight.  It is an ugly thing to see how far
we have fallen from Jesus's perspective.  Do you think you want to
know how really ignorant you are?  Do you think Brian Kendig wants
to know?  Do you think I want to know?  Ego verses the truth,
which do you choose?

>I'm watching the news about a man who saw the light, and made

>into the light. I don't think the world is that simple. And if 
>you act in such ways when you are enlighted, then I'm a happy
>man and I pray I will never receive such 'light'.

And I watched Koresh too, an imposter who thought he saw the light, 
who made sure that the 19 children burned to death, sadly, as part
of his delusion.  It is even sadder that the people who
died with him chose to die with them, and that ignorance was
their downfall to death. 

And Kent, don't you bury yourself underneath a rock with an
excuse like bringing up Koresh--as if Koresh actually had truth in him.
David Koresh was no light and no excuse for
you to stay away from the real Jesus Christ.  David Koresh, who
claimed to be Jesus, was a fraud.  It was obvious.  David Koresh
was born in America. Jesus was born in Bethlehem.  Koresh wasn't
even a good imposter having missed an obvious point as that.

Jesus warned of such imposters in the end-times.  David
Koresh wasn't anything new to Jesus.  Jesus told us to be
aware of imposters 2000 years ago.  

So the next time an imposter makes a scene and claims to
be Jesus.  Ask the obvious.  Where were you born?  Was your
mother's name Mary?  If the Branch Davidians asked that
simple question, they would have labeled Koresh a liar
right from the start.  The wouldn't have followed Koresh.
They wouldn't have died.  But look what happened.  Their
ignorance cost them their lives.  Their choice to be ignorant
cost them a lot.

Kent, since you studied the Bible under Lutheranism, do you
not remember what tactic Satan used to try to tempt Jesus?  
Did not Satan quote the Bible out of context?  Do you
remember what tactic the serpent of Genesis used to tempt
Eve?  Did he not misquote God?  What Satan used on Eve and succeeded, 
was the same ploy he tried on Jesus.  But in Jesus's case,
Jesus rebuked Satan back with the Bible _in_ context.  It
didn't work with Jesus.  

Does what Satan did to Eve in the Garden and what Satan
tried to do with Jesus in the desert remind you of what
Koresh did to his followers?  Who did Koresh emulate?
Who was Koresh's teacher?  Koresh did to his followers what
Satan did to Eve.  Did not Koresh kill his followersr?  Did
not Satan cause Adam and Eve to die as well?  Did not
the cult followers believe Koresh even though they knew
the real Christ was born in Bethlehem?   Did not Eve
choose to eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and
evil despite knowing that it would cause her death?  God
held them all responsible--deceiver and the rebeller.  None 
of them had an excuse.  

As opposed to the Branch Davidians, we have a second chance.
Follow Jesus and he will escort us to the path of eternal life.
Don't follow Jesus, and you stand condemned already, for like
the Branch Davidian complex, your house is already on fire.
Satan, Adam and Eve have already set it ablaze.   It is just
a slow burn, but it is burning nevertheless.

[...stiff deleted...]

Speed is a quantifiable measure resulting from a set of methods that
will result in the same value measured no matter the reference.  A 
bullet with zero velocity sitting on a table on a train moving 60mph
will be moving at a speed of

        (a) 0mph to someone on the train.
        (b) 60mph to someone stationary next to the train.

The reference frame makes the speed relative.  But what's interesting
here is that every person on the train will see a stationary bullet.
Every person off, a bullet moving 60mph.  

I know of no train where all the people on it, every time it is
filled, will see a moral problem in exactly the same way.

If the set is direct line powered, try checking the [likely to be
there] hybrid regulator module down stream from the 170 volt
supply.  Several sets I've looked at use a 135 volt regulator.  The
regulators have a tendency to short out, making the safety circuits
shut down the EHT supply section.

Try putting the set on a Variac or adjustable transformer and lower
the AC input voltage to the set to about 90 volts.  If the set
operates nromally, then you know you've got a shorted regulator.

There are myriad other areas for problems, but I've seen the one
above several times.  Also, if the set uses one, the trippler
module may be shot; that's fairly common.

I recommend the book "Adams _v_ Texas", the story of a man (Adams) who
was sentenced to death for a crime he didn't commit.  Most of the book
is the story of the long appeals process, and the problems and delays
caused by not being able to introduce new evidence in certain courts.

If he had a history of such things, why was it not mentioned in the

I can't say exactly who is at fault here, but from where I sit is
looks like we're seeing the results either of the law going way out
of hand or of shoddy journalism.

If the law wants to attach strings to how you spend a settlement, they
should put the money in trust.  They don't, so I would assume it's
perfectly legitimate to drink it away, though I wouldn't spend it that
way myself.

Well, I am not Andy, but if you had familiarized yourself with some of

would be aware of the fact that none of them claims that proteins were
assembled randomly from amino acids. It is current thinking that RNA-

were assembled by some kind of primitive translation machinery.

Yes, it was Nixon who was most vocal about giving money to Russia.  It
makes me proud to be a libertarian.  It appears both conservatives and
liberals prefer to cold war until you win, then nurse the enemy back to
health for another go around.

It's like subsidizing the wealthy countries (Japan, Germany, etc.) with
free defense, and then trade-warring with them because of the economic
competition.  It's like subsidizing tobacco farmers while paying
bureaucrats to pursuade people not to smoke.

I ask myself, what law could we pass to prevent government from doing
stupid, frivilous things with OUR money?  Then I think, the Constitution
was supposed to do that.  Could someone please tell me what legitimate
constitutional power the federal government is using when it takes money
from my paycheck and gives it to needy countries?  Seriously.

Insurance companies sure seem to go for No-Fault coverage.  Since the
majority of accidents are the cagers' fault, doesn't this imply that we
would have to pay much higher rates under a No-Fault system?

With a cars-only system, it seems to make sense on the surface: take the
legal costs out of the system.  But it looks like motorcyclists would
get screwed.

Actually, there are people who will tell you that it *would* be enough
to do SSTO development, if done privately as a cut-rate operation.  Of
course, they may be over-optimistic.

You can also assume that a working SSTO would have other applications
that would help pay for its development costs.

I'd be inclined to make the prize somewhat larger, but $1G might be enough.

Lets see what the dictionary has to say:

from a mental concept. 2. Having actual existance. 3.a. Uninfluenced

Otherwise their headquarters in San Jose has a pretty decent
metaphysical bookstore, if any of you are interested in such books.
And my son loves to run around in their Egyptian museum.


Response:

Indeed, and diagonally across the street is another metaphysical
book store called 'Ram Metaphysical', wherein I've purchased some
wonderful works by Crowley and others.  Ram Metaphysical Books,
1749 Park Ave., San Jose, CA.  (408) 294-2651.

I understand and sympathize with your pain.  What happened in Waco was a very
sad tradgedy.  Don't take it out on us Christians though.  The Branch
Davidians were not an organized religion.  They were a cult led by a ego-maniac
cult leader.  The Christian faith stands only on the shoulders of one man,
the Lord of Lords and King of Kings, Jesus Christ.   BTW, David Koresh was NOT
Jesus Christ as he claimed.

God be with you,

	Is there no JUSTICE?!

	If I lost my leg when I was 19, and had to give up motorcycling
(assuming David didn't know that it can be done one-legged,) I too would want
to get swamped.... maybe even for ten years!  I'll admit, I'd probably prefer
homebrew to pubbrew, but still...

	Judge Coterill is in some serious trouble, I can tell you that.  Any
chance you can get to him and convince him his ruling was backward, Nick?

	Perhaps the lad deserved something for starting a brawl (bad form...
horribly bad form,) but for getting drunk?  That, I thought, was ones natural
born right!  And for spending his own money?  My goodness, who cares what one
does with one's own moolah, even if one spends it recklessly?

Let's see, if Alexander destroyed Tyre, and people move back, and
they construct houses, and after a while 14000 people live there
and still call it Tyre, it is not considered to be rebuilt. Instead
it's considered to be 'just-some-people-that-got-together-for-fishing-
and-they-needed-houses' place.

Sigh, I was never born in a city then (my home town has 10.000
people). I have to consult my city and inform them that it's from
now a fishing village. When this city (Kristinestad) was founded
in the 17:th century about 1000 people lived there, so the norms
were even more bizarre for dumb Swedish queens who founded cities
along the coast of Finland.

I would like to know why Paul thought is was worth mentioning the 
small fishing place of Tyre in Acts. Again, maybe he was a keen
fisherman and wanted to visit the shores of Tyre? :-)

NETWORK RESOURCES

OVERVIEW

    You may be reading this document on any one of an amazing variety of
    computers, so much of the material below may not apply to you. In
    general, however, systems connected to 'the net' fall in one of three
    categories: Internet, Usenet, or BITNET. Electronic mail may be sent
    between these networks, and other resources available on one of these
    networks are sometimes accessible from other networks by email sent to
    special 'servers'.

    The space and astronomy discussion groups actually are composed of
    several mechanisms with (mostly) transparent connections between them.

    One mechanism is the mailing list, in which mail is sent to a central
    distribution point which relays it to all recipients of the list. In
    addition to the general lists for space (called SPACE Digest for
    Internet users, and SPACE on BITNET), there are a number of more
    specialized mailing lists described below.

    A second mechanism is Usenet 'netnews'. This is somewhat like a bulletin
    board operating on each system which is a part of the net. Netnews
    separates contributions into hundreds of different categories based on a
    'group name'. The groups dealing most closely with space topics are
    called 'sci.space.news', 'sci.space', 'sci.space.shuttle', 'sci.astro',
    and 'talk.politics.space'. Contributors 'post' submissions (called
    'articles' in netnews terminology) on their local machine, which sends
    it to other nearby machines. Similarly, articles sent from nearby
    machines are stored locally and may be forwarded to other systems, so
    that an article is posted locally and eventually reaches all the Usenet
    sites interested in receiving the news group to which the article was
    posted.

    Gateway machines redirect the Usenet sci.space group into Internet and
    BITNET mailing lists and vice versa; the other Usenet groups are not
    accessible as mailing lists. If you can receive netnews, its more
    flexible interface and access to a wider range of material usually make
    it the preferred option.

MAILING LISTS

    SPACE Digest is the main Internet list, and is now being run by the
    International Space University (in only its second change of management
    in over a decade). Email space-request@isu.isunet.edu (message body
    should be in the format 'subscribe space John Public') to join. Note
    that the moderated SPACE Magazine list is defunct at present for lack of
    a moderator. Old copies of SPACE Digest since its inception in 1981 are
    available by anonymous FTP. Retrieve
	julius.cs.qub.ac.uk:pub/SpaceDigestArchive/README
    for further details.

    Elements is a moderated list for fast distribution of Space Shuttle
    Keplerian Elements before and during Shuttle flights. NASA two line
    elements are sent out on the list from Dr. Kelso, JSC, and other sources
    as they are released. Email to elements-request@telesoft.com to join.

    GPS Digest is a moderated list for discussion of the Global Positioning
    System and other satellite navigation positioning systems. Email to
    gps-request@esseye.si.com to join.

    Space-investors is a list for information relevant to investing in
    space-related companies. Email Vincent Cate (vac@cs.cmu.edu) to join.

    Space-tech is a list for more technical discussion of space topics;
    discussion has included esoteric propulsion technologies, asteroid
    capture, starflight, orbital debris removal, etc. Email to
    space-tech-request@cs.cmu.edu to join. Archives of old digests and
    selected excerpts are available by anonymous FTP from
    gs80.sp.cs.cmu.edu (128.2.205.90) in /usr/anon/public/space-tech,
    or by email to space-tech-request if you don't have FTP access.

    SEDS-L is a BITNET list for members of Students for the Exploration and
    Development of Space and other interested parties. Email
    LISTSERV@TAMVM1.BITNET with a message saying "SUBSCRIBE SEDS-L your
    name". Email saying "INDEX SEDS-L" to list the archive contents.

    SEDSNEWS is a BITNET list for news items, press releases, shuttle status
    reports, and the like. This duplicates material which is also found in
    Space Digest, sci.space, sci.space.shuttle, and sci.astro. Email
    LISTSERV@TAMVM1.BITNET saying "SUBSCRIBE SEDSNEWS your name" to join.
    Email saying "INDEX SEDSNEWS" to list the archive contents.

    Ron Baalke (baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov) runs a mailing list which
    carries the contents of the sci.space.news Usenet group. Email him
    to join the list.

    As a general note, please mail to the *request* address to get off a
    mailing list. SPACE Digest, for example, relays many inappropriate
    'please remove me from this list' messages which are sent to the list
    address rather than the request address.

PERIODICALLY UPDATED INFORMATION

Here's my own top ten response to Mr. Ipser's list


10.  It's about time we have a President that might actually stand up to the
     military.  Our men and women in uniform must learn that the world does not
     revolve around them, and that one of the things they're out there defending
     is our right to be critical of them, even denounce them.

9.   Let me explain something to you.  Environmental policy and industrial
     policy MUST go hand in hand.  Our nation, and indeed, our planet cannot
     afford to continue ignoring this as was done over the last twelve years.
     Our industrial/environmental position has been downright SHAMEFUL! We
     must have active government support of the key industries such as,
     telecommunications, microelectronics, medical, biotech, and environmental
     tech.  Meanwhile weed out old, inneficient, high-polution, industries
     that are better left to other nations.  This will make us richer, help
     produce new jobs, and help the environment.  To give credit where credit
     is due, I heard a lot of this in a speech by Senator John Kerry (D-MA)
     tonite.  In addition, it's time we get really, really serious about 
     issues like overpopulation, globabl warming, and ozone depletion.  The
     planet on which we live should be our utmost priority!

8.   It just so happens that that it takes money to make this country work,
     to provide the services that people need, and to help solve the problems
     that need to be solved.  Granted, some things can probably be done more
     efficiently for less money, and should be.  But some things are going to
     cost more money and I'm sick and tired of hearing everyone whining about
     taxes all the time.  You want to live in my country, you pay your fair
     share!

7.   I can't believe what hypocrites people are when they ask people to give
     up their lives for their country and then complain about taxes.  If you're
     willing to send me off to die for some stupid obsession with fighting an
     enemy which at best doesn't affect us and at worst really should be our
     friend, then you have no right to tell me you shouldn't pay taxes!

6.   Hey, I think the beaded curtains add a lovely 60's-esque touch!

5.   Look, Canada, Europe, and Japan manage to provide health care for their
     citizens (and, yes, basic health IS a human right which people are
     entitled to).  If these nations aren't capitalist enough for you, then
     I guess we've found something better than capitalism!  There is nothing
     sacred about the capitalist system, and if something, be it socialism
     or anything else, works better, then I say let capitalism die.

4.   Make love, not War!

3.   Contrary to popular belief, it is possible to be a male and a feminist
     at the same time.  To discriminate against or to deny equal opportunity
     to a MAJORITY of the population is just plain wrong, and trying to force
     them into some sort of tradition role is even worse.  Women certainly 
     have as much to offer this world as men, and the day that gender
     discrimination is finally broken it going to make all the revolutions of
     the past few centuries seem like reform bills.  I look forward to it.

2.   See number 10.

_Cycle World_ puts one out, but I'm sure it's not very objective.  Try talking
with dealers and the people that hang out there, as well as us.  We love to
give advice.

Most of the bigger banks have a blue book which includes motos -- ask for the
one with RVs in it.

Couldn't help you here.

From what I've seen in my 17 years as an MOA member, most of the folks
in the RA are also in the MOA... I guess it's called covering all the
bases to get some idea of what is really happening.. How else does one
think the RA gets all the juicey news about what's happen' inside the 
MOA?

I would hardly consider the BD's to be Christian.  They were acting in
direct contradiction to scripture.  Jesus' Second Coming is something
that everyone will know of.  Jesus also predicted that there will be
false Messiahs who will use His name.  His prophecy has been fulfilled.

Do you judge all Christians by the acts of those who would call
themselves Christian and yet are not?  The BD's contradicted scripture
in their actions.  They were NOT Christian.  Simple as that.  Perhaps
you have read too much into what the media has portrayed.  Ask any
true-believing Christian and you will find that they will deny any
association with the BD's.  Even the 7th Day Adventists have denied any
further ties with this cult, which was what they were.

Do you judge all Muslims by the acts committed by Saddam Hussein, a 
supposedly devout Muslim?  I don't.  Saddam is just a dictator using
the religious beliefs of his people to further his own ends.

God be with you,

Malcolm Lee   :)

I aint talking the large or even the "mining companies" I am talking the small
miners, the people who have themselves and a few employees (if at all).The
people who go out every year and set up thier sluice box, and such and do
mining the semi-old fashion way.. (okay they use modern methods toa point).

I am talking the guy who coem to Nome evry year, sets up his tent on the beach
(the beach was washed away last year) and sets up his/her sluice box and goes
at it "mining".
I know the large corps, such as Alaska Gold Company, might complain to..

My opinions are what I learn at the local BS table..

My original thing/idea was that the way to get space mining was to allow the
eco-freaks thier way.. As they have done with other mineral development.
You can't in many places can't go to the bathroom in the woods without some
form of regulation covering it..

Who says there is no mineral rights to be given? Who says? The UN or the US
Government? 
Major question is if you decide to mine the moon or Mars, who will stop you?
The UN can't other than legal tom foolerie.. Can the truly inforce it?

If you go to the moon as declare that you are now a soverign nation, who will
stop you from doing it. Maybe not acknowledge you? 

Why can't a small company or corp or organization go an explore the great
beyond of space? what right does earth have to say what is legal and what is
not.. Maybe I am a few years ahead on this.. It is liek the old Catholic Church 
stating which was Portugals and what was Spains, and along came the Reformation
and made it all null and void.. 

What can happen is to find a nation which is acknowledged, and offer your
services as a space miner and then go mine the asteroids/mars/moon or what
ever.. As long as yur sponsor does not get in trouble..
Basically find a country who wants to go into space, but can't for soem reason
or another, but who will give you a "home".. Such as Saudia Arabia or
whatever..
There are nations in the World who are not part of the UN, got to them and
offer your services and such.. I know that sound crazy, but. is it..
Also once you have the means to mine the moon (or whatever) then just do it.
The UN if done right can be made to be so busy with something else, they will
not care.. 
If your worried about the US, do the same thing..

Why be limited by the short sighted people of earth.. After all they have many
other things to worry about that if someone is mining the Moon or MArs or what
ever..
Basically what I am saying is where is that drive of yeasteryears to go a
little bit farther out, to do jus ta  little bit more, and to tell the crown to
piss off.. If my ancestors thought the way many today think, Id have been born
in Central Europe just north of the Black Sea..

I just read a good book, "Tower of the Gods" Interesting..

Kent: With all due respect, how can I take you seriously, when you have
the NAMES wrong in the 1st place? E.g.:

	There is no such thing. The correct name is Ancient & Mystical
Order Rosae Crucis, abbreviated AMORC.

>...and the Rocicrusian

	There is no such thing either. It's the Rosicrucian Fellowship.
And they clearly state that they DO NOT pretend to descend from the
Order of the Fama Fraternitatis.

>In addition there are many splinter groups

The Lectorium? And who else?

These are NOT Rosicrucian "orders". They are Masonic study groups, none
of which *claims* to be descendant of the original Order.

My understanding is that the 'expected errors' are basically
known bugs in the warning system software - things are checked
that don't have the right values in yet because they aren't
set till after launch, and suchlike. Rather than fix the code
and possibly introduce new bugs, they just tell the crew
'ok, if you see a warning no. 213 before liftoff, ignore it'.

OH yes they do! but considering i never wash my BMW (unless i need
to work on it) i never get cuts untill the tools come out.....
altho the best scar (now faded) was from the exhaust piper,
while try to change the oil, after overheating the engine (watch
out for idiot drivers that won't let you pass in the mountains
when you have a rider, case of oil (it was on sale), and case of 
beer), with a drain bolt that decided to seize.

just how does everyone else clean out the area under the transmission
on a BMW R bike? they only way i have found is to remove the
engine and transmission. that and the clutch arm are impossible to
clean (which is wear one of the EC (s&m) are located).

cheap. also how much should that run.

Judging from past experience (the '87 March, a Peace and Justice March the 
same year, and 3 different Pro-coice Marches), The Park Service will come out
with an estimate that is approximately 1/2 the estimate that organizers will
come up with - though the last Choice march I went to had a sign-in system, 
and the numbers ended up closer.  And then you've got the media types in their
helicopters, rolling dice.

I believe the MOW plans and handing out some sort of wristband thingy, and 
basing their count on those.  I see two problems with this.  One, can they 
get *everybody* to take one (and only one)?  Two, they couldn't possibly have
been able to choose a color/design that won't clash with *somebody's* outfit!

burning yourself alive seems a rough way to go, given the waco bunch
had other choices.

but it reminded me of the russian old-believers who, thinking the
antichrist was coming in 1666, grew frantic when Peter the Great 
started westernizing Russia and reforming the Russian Church a few
years later. They locked themselves in their churches and burned
themselves alive by the thousands. 

are there other cases of apocalypse-obsessed christians resorting
to self-imolation? is there a history of precedents?

There are no Mariner craft from which we are still receiving data.  I believe
you are referring to one or more of Pioneers 6 through 9 (launched from
December 1965 through November 1968), which were put into solar orbits to study
interplanetary space.  I recall reading that at least one of them was still

Plus, one palced will give me C7C for my car + liab on the bike for

So I won't go with the first place I called, that's

Later on, the Andersons tried to shed their reputation as creators of some
of the worst pseudo-scientific shows in TV history by flying "Into Infinity."
This was a one-off thing done as part of BBC's "educational SF" series "The
Day After Tomorrow." The Anderson episode dealt with a spaceship capable of
reaching the speed of light ("lightship Altares"), the four-man crew eventually 
journeyed into a black hole and ended up on the far side of the galaxy (I
think). I saw this as a 9-year-old back in 1976 and liked it very much, but
then again I was a fan of SPACE:1999 so I guess I was easily satisfied in those
days:-)

     Just briefly, on something that you mentioned in passing. You refer to
     differing interpretations of "create," and say that many Christians may
     not agree. So what? That is really irrelevant. We do not base our faith
     on how many people think one way or another, do we? The bottom line is
     truth, regardless of popularity of opinions.

     Also, I find it rather strange that in trying to persuade that created
     and eternally existent are equivalent, you say "granted the Mormon
     belief..." You can't grant your conclusion and then expect the point to
     have been addressed. In order to reply to the issue, you have to address
     and answer the point that was raised, and not just jump to the
     conclusion that you grant.

     The Bible states that Lucifer was created.  The Bible states that Jesus
     is the creator of all. The contradiction that we have is that the LDS
     belief is that Jesus and Lucifer were the same.

     The Mormon belief is that all are children of God. Literally. There is
     nothing symbolic about it. This however, contradicts what the Bible
     says. The Bible teaches that not everyone is a child of God:

          The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the 
          kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked [one];
          (Matthew 13:38)

          I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and ye do that which 
          ye have seen with your father. (John 8:38)

          Ye do the deeds of your father. Then said they to him, We be not 
          born of fornication; we have one Father, [even] God.  Jesus said 
          unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I 
          proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he 
          sent me.  Why do ye not understand my speech? [even] because ye 
          cannot hear my word.  Ye are of [your] father the devil, and the 
          lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the 
          beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in 
          him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a 
          liar, and the father of it. (John 8:41-44)

          And said, O full of all subtilty and all mischief, [thou] child of 
          the devil, [thou] enemy of all righteousness, wilt thou not cease 
          to pervert the right ways of the Lord? (Acts 13:10)

          Wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this 
          world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit 
          that now worketh in the children of disobedience: (Ephesians 2:2)

          In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the 
          devil: whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God, neither he 
          that loveth not his brother. (1 John 3:10)

     One becomes a child of God...

          But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the
          sons of God, [even] to them that believe on his name: (John 1:12)

          Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that
          we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world knoweth us
          not, because it knew him not.  Beloved, now are we the sons of God,
          and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when
          he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he
          is. (1 John 3:1-2)

     ...when he is born again through faith in Jesus Christ:

          Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of
          the will of man, but of God. (John 1:13)

          Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus
          Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will,
          (Ephesians 1:5)

          Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should
          be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures. (James 1:18)

          For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of
          God. For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear;
          but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba,
          Father. The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we
          are the children of God: (Romans 8:14-16)

          Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one
          that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God. (1 John 4:7)

          Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God: and
          every one that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is
          begotten of him. (1 John 5:1)

          For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.
          (Galatians 3:26)

     This is really a red herring. It doesn't address any issue raised, but 
     rather, it seeks to obfuscate. The fact that some groups try to read 
     something into the Bible, doesn't change what the Bible teaches. For 
     example, the fact that the Jehovah's Witnesses deny the Deity of Christ 
     does not alter what the Bible teaches [ "Looking for that blessed hope,
     and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus
     Christ;" (Titus 2:13),"Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus
     Christ, to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through
     the righteousness of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ:" (2 Peter 1:1)] 
     on the Deity of Christ.

     We first look to the Bible to see what it teaches. To discount, or not 
     even address, what the Bible teaches because there are some groups that 
     have differing views is self-defeating. To see what the Bible teaches, 
     you have to look at the Bible.

     I find this rather curious. When I mentioned that the Mormon belief is
     that Jesus needed to be saved, I put forward some quotes from the late
     apostle, Bruce McConkie. The curious part is that no one addressed the
     issue of `Jesus needing to be saved.' Rick comes the closest with his "I
     have my own conclusions" to addressing the point.

     Most of the other replies have instead hop-scotched to the issue of
     Bruce McConkie and whether his views were 'official doctrine.' I don't
     think that it matters if McConkie's views were canon. That is not the
     issue.  Were McConkie's writings indicative of Mormon belief on this
     subject is the real issue. The indication from Rick is that they may 
     certainly be.

Unfortunately, you're wrong on both counts.  The most common method of
implementing a tunable receiver is to have a local oscillator.  The
local oscillator's frequency can be radiated out of the receiver via
the antenna unless the circuit is designed and constructed with great
care.

For a reference on detecting radios, get the paperback book _Spy Catcher_.
The author discovered how to detect radio receivers from their local
oscillator emissions back in the *1950s* while he worked for British
Intelligence.

I was wrong. I admit that I do not have a handle on Greek grammar, and thus
confused "kleros", the second to last word in Acts 1:17 as being the plot of
land discussed.  In actuality it is "chorion", which is the last word Acts
1:18.  Unfortunately my Greek dictionary does not discuss "chorion" so I
cannot report as to the nuances of the word.
 
I don't know if someone else would have caught this, though I am sure that
someone would be able to do so, but I have an aversion to disseminating
mistakes, especially when someone else might use that mistake to prove a point"

MY REPLY...
Good point.  But in your declaring that these passages are contradictory, you
have produced only superficial reasonings and observations. Nor have you dug
deeper.  I'm glad you have begun in this post.  I will begin Greek studies on
these passages in more depth than I thought necessary, as well.

"It would be appropriate to look at what Mr DeCenso has actually USED as
evidence.  Now we know what he claims for a standard, as he has stated it

But are these actual standards he has used, or simply empty hyperbole.  Let's
see, he has used (a), and since he is trying to reconcile it to other
passages, we see that he has also used (b).  On the other hand he has
presented no use of:
 
(d) historical context                or
(e) historical content                or
(f) other pertinent historical info   or

Thus we find his vaunted criteria for exegisis is just empty mouthings."
 
MY REPLY...
Question:  Do you find such criteria important?  If so, do you plan on starting
to use them to the best of your ability, or will you continue to present
shallow observations (I don't mean this in a bad way).
At this point in our _debates_, I have not found it necessary to present a
total exegetical analysis of these passages, since we seem to keep beating
around the bush and not getting into the core of the verses.  I do not believe
it necessary to use many of the above criteria to refute your arguments re:
Judas in Acts and Matthew, but I will do my best from this point on to use
several of the above criteria, since you desire me to.  I hope you will also.
It will greatly enhance our study of these passages.

The reason is simple...you are mistating the passages.  You claim that the
PASSAGES contradict one another; I do not see the PASSAGES contradicting one
another.
(1) They may very well be complimentary, as many scholarly sources mention;
(2) Matthew may not be presenting Judas' death, as you claim.  But we'll look
at your defense of this later.
 
Also, the "reward of iniquity" in the Acts PASSAGE may not be the 30 pieces of
silver in Matthew's PASSAGES.  (Although you have a valiant attempt later at
stating why you believe it is).
 
At this beginning stages in our debates, we are laying some Scriptural
groundwork, which will be expanded upon through deeper exegesis.
 
DB...
"Of course the only reason I can see to so drastically reinterpret a passage
as he has done with Judas' death, is to make it agree with another passage so
that both could be considered correct."

One of the reasons I have given a different exegetical view of the passages is
that you seem to think the majority of scholarship is wrong in concluding these
passages are complimentary.  However, I see no problem in Tony Rose's
explanation of Judas' death...
 
_____________________________________________________________________
 
HOW WOULD YOU EXPLAIN THE INACCURACY BETWEEN JUDAS HANGING
HIMSELF IN MATTHEW 27:5 AND "FALLING HEADLONG HE BURST OPEN"
=============================================================
 
This question of the manner in which Judas died is one with which we are
constantly confronted in our travels. Many people point to the apparent
discrepancy in the two accounts as an obvious, irreconcilable error.
Some have gone so far as to say that the idea of an inerrant Bible is
destroyed by these contradictory accounts. However, this is not the case at
all.
Matthew relates that Judas hanged himself, while Peter tells us he fell and
was crushed by the impact. The two statements are indeed different, but do
they necessarily contradict each other?
Matthew does not say that Judas did not fall; neither does Peter say that
Judas did not hang himself. This is not a matter of one person calling
something black and the other person calling it white. Both accounts can be
true and supplementary.
A possible reconstruction would be this: Judas hanged himself on a tree on the
edge of a precipice that overlooked the valley of Hinnom. After he hung there
for some time, the limb of the tree snapped or the rope gave way and Judas
fell down the ledge, mangling his body in the process.
The fall could have been before *or* after death as either would fit this
explanation. This possibility is entirely natural when the terrain of the
valley of Hinnom is examined.  From the bottom of the valley, you can see
rocky terraces 25 to 40 feet in height and almost perpendicular.
There are still trees around the ledges and a rocky pavement at the bottom.
Therefore, it is easy to conclude that Judas struck one of the jagged rocks on
this way down, tearing his body open. It is important to remember that we are
not told how long Judas remained hanging from the tree or how advanced
was the decomposition of his body before his fall.
Louis Gaussen relates a story of a man who was determined to kill himself.
This individual placed himself on the sill of a high window and pointed a
pistol at his head. He then pulled the trigger and leaped from the window at
the same time.
On the other hand, a person could say that this man took his life by shooting
himself, while another could rightly contend he committed suicide by jumping
form the tall building. In this case, both are true, as both are true in the
case of Matthew's and Peter's accounts of the death of Judas. It is merely a
situation of different perspectives of the same event.

Your only reason for rejecting this is, I believe, your attempt to discredit
inerrancy.  You haven't related how this is IMPOSSIBLE or highly unlikely.
Here's what you said in an earlier post...

"The added text in this version is so heavy that, assuming you are truly so
opposed to such tactics, you should find it not credible.  But you seem to
find Tony Rose's eisegesis satisfactory, while clearly rejecting David
Joslin's."

Here, you discredit Tony's explanation based on what you deem too "heavy" for
the passages.  But you haven't addressed why you feel that way.  You can say
it's a vain attempt to reconcile the contradiction, but that doesn't tell me it
didn't happen, nor have you shown why you reject that possibility.
 
Questions:  Is Matthew lying or is Luke lying?  Or are they both lying?  Or
are either or both of them misinformed?  Why do you think there is such an
alleged contradiction?  I do not think you have ever told us what you believe
in this respect.

Actually I find question (1) to be a rather stupid request, but I will answer
it because he now restricts himself to two points.  First I would point out
that hanging is a very efficient manner for ending a life.  In fact it is a
bit of a fluke when someone survives hanging (except in fantasy cowboy
movies), and even then it usually referred to as an attempted hanging."
 
MY REPLY...
I work at an agency that investigates child abuse and neglect.  Today, I got a
call re: a child that attempted suicide by hanging himself because his mother
is on crack.  He failed in his attempt and is in a child's psych ward at a
local hospital.  Hanging attempts are not always successful.
 
To assume that because most hangings are successful, this one was also is
"begging the question", if I may quote you.
 
[Last night, listening to _The Bible Answer Man_ broadcast, The Christian
Research Institute's show, one of the scholars on there used several of these
terms that you use.  I am not all that familiar with them.  The man on the BAM
show teaches Comparative Religion and Logic.  It was interesting]
 
DB...
"This is so prevalent that, so that to say a man hung himself with no other
qualifiers is synonymous with stating that he killed himself."
 
MY REPLY...
Qualifiers are important at times, as we'll see in an OT passage I'll mention
below.
Does hanging ALWAYS have this outcome?  Did Matthew, who is the only source we
have re: Judas hanging himself, state that Judas died as a result?  To say it's
synonymous means it has the same meaning as.  A boy (age 14) hung himself.  But
he lived.  This is only one of probably thousands of documented cases we can
discover.

So it's OK to use Christian sources to back your points?  What about Tony's
position.  Do you value it or even consider it as a valid possibility?
 
Also, is it possible that the sources you read may be wrong, or lying, or
deceived in other parts of their books?  If so, should we do, as we have done
with Archer, toss them to the side and not value anything they say, including
their "interpretation" of the hanging of Judas?  I am sure _you_ would find
some errors and maybe even some deception in those sources.
 
You also noted they "interpreted" the hanging as meaning he died.  Although
that is very possibly true, do you find that in the text itself?  Remember,
that's the first criteria we must examine.

in how we both should approach these alleged contradictions - more in depth
study.

No you can't only conclude this, although, as Tony says, this was a highly
probable outcome.  But Matthew does not state death as being a result.
 
The Greek word is APAGCHO.  Matthew 27:5 is it's only occurrence in the New
Testament.
 
In the Septuagint (the Greek translation of the OT used at the time of Jesus),
it's only used in 2 Samuel 17:23 : "Now when Ahithophel saw that his advice was
not followed, he saddled a donkey, and arose and went home to his house, to his
city. Then he put his household in order, and hanged himself, and died; and he
was buried in his father's tomb."             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 
Notice that not only is it stated that Ahithophel "hanged himself" [Gr. Sept.,
APAGCHO], but it explicitly adds, "and died".  Here we have no doubt of the
result.
In Matthew, we are not explicitly told Judas died.
 
Also, there is nothing in the Greek to suggest success or failure.  It simply
means "hang oneself".

As far as   insisting that the hanging was unsuccessful, that can't be done,
even by me. ^^^^^^^^^

_____________________________________________________________________
Although I still agree with Tony's exegesis as being the most probable
explanation regarding Judas' death (taking into account several criteria),
I've recently noticed some new things in Matthew.
 
MAT 27:5-8 Then he threw down the pieces of silver in the temple and departed,
and went and hanged himself. But the chief priests took the silver pieces and
said, "It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, because they are the
price of blood." And they consulted together and bought with them the potter's
field, to bury strangers in. Therefore that field has been called the Field of
Blood to this day.
 
First of all, notice that the text does not say that Judas died as a result of
hanging. All it says is that he "went and hanged himself." Luke however, in
Acts, tells us that "and falling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all
his entrails gushed out." This is a pretty clear indication (along with the
other details given in Acts - Peter's speech, the need to pick a new apostle,
etc.) that at least after Judas' fall, he was dead. So the whole concept that

Here we have a stickler, Dave, that I have to say I just recently noticed.
Let's look at the passage in Matthew:
 
MAT 27:4 saying, "I have sinned by betraying innocent blood." And they said,
"What is that to us? You see to it!"
 
MAT 27:5 Then he threw down the pieces of silver in the temple and departed,
and went and hanged himself.
 
MAT 27:6 But the chief priests took the silver pieces and said, "It is not
lawful to put them into the treasury, because they are the price of blood."
 
MAT 27:7 And they consulted together and bought with them the potter's field,
to bury strangers in.
 
MAT 27:8 Therefore that field has been called the Field of Blood to this day.
 
Notice verse 5..."Then he...went and hanged himself."
Matthew does not say Judas died, does it?  Should we assume he died as a
result of the hanging?                     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
What does Acts say?
ACT 1:18 (Now this man purchased a field with the wages of iniquity; and
falling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all his entrails gushed out.
 
ACT 1:20 "For it is written in the book of Psalms: 'Let his dwelling place be
desolate, And let no one live in it'; and, 'Let another take his office.'
 
Here we may have a graphic explanation of Judas' death....So, my line of
reasoning to dispel your contradiction myth re:the "two" accounts of Judas'
death is this...Matthew doesn't necessarily explain how Judas died; he does
                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
say Judas "hanged himself", but he didn't specifically say Judas died in the
hanging incident.               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
However, Acts seems to show us his graphic demise.  Therefore, there is no
contradiction between Matthew and Acts re: Judas' `death'.

MY REPLY...
...we do know from Matthew that he did hang himself and Acts probably records
his death.  Although it's possible and plausible that he fell from the hanging
and hit some rocks, thereby bursting open, I can no longer assume that to be
the case.  Therefore, no contradiction.  Matthew did not say Judas died as a
                                         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
result of the hanging, did he?  Most scholars believe he probably did, but...?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
______________________________________________________________________
 
I quoted all that to show that I highly regard the scholars' explanations, but
in looking at the texts initially, we can't assume Judas died.  It is, however,
highly probable.                            ^^^^^^
 
DB...
"By the way, while all agree that Judas died from the hanging, the books had
different ways of dealing with the contradiction we are discussing.  One
simply ignored it entirely and simply referred back to Matthew's version as
the correct version in both Matt and Acts.  "The Biblical Knowledge Commentary"
suggested the hypotheses that Judas hung and then when he rotted, his belly
exploded (which doesn't explain his headlong fall), or that his branch or rope
broke, and he fell to his death and his gut gushed out (which doesn't explain
how a hanging man, would fall headlong rather than feet first)."
 
MY REPLY...
The outcome of any fall is dependent upon many factors...how high the person
was suspended before the fall, any obstructions such as tree branches that may
have deviated the fall, how steep an incline of rocky surfaces the victim fell
upon, thus possibly rolling or bouncing of several rocks, etc.  In a
superficial examination of the Acts passage and the Matthew passage, we are not
given a lot of info on the geographical specifics, but Tony in the above quoted
post gave us some...
 
_____________________________________________________________________
A possible reconstruction would be this: Judas hanged himself on a tree on the
edge of a precipice that overlooked the valley of Hinnom. After he hung there
for some time, the limb of the tree snapped or the rope gave way and Judas
fell down the ledge, mangling his body in the process.
The fall could have been before *or* after death as either would fit this
explanation. This possibility is entirely natural when the terrain of the
valley of Hinnom is examined.  From the bottom of the valley, you can see
rocky terraces 25 to 40 feet in height and almost perpendicular.
There are still trees around the ledges and a rocky pavement at the bottom.
Therefore, it is easy to conclude that Judas struck one of the jagged rocks on
this way down, tearing his body open.
_____________________________________________________________________

Now truthfully, I do not see what is comforting about Matthew confusing the
source of the Potter's field prophesy, but on the other hand the author is
correct: Matthew does make that confusion.  Of course a Biblical inerrantist
who claim that every word of the Bible is guaranteed true by God, will have to
thereby add one more contradiction to the death of Judas (ie: where the
prophesy of the Potter's field came from)."
 
MY REPLY...
Please, when we are done with this study on his death, remind me to discuss
this with you.
 
DB...
As to your second question Mr DeCenso, you ask how we could be sure that the
money with which Judas purchased the land, was indeed for the betrayal, rather
than some other source.  I would point out that in Acts, where it specifically
mention "the reward of iniquity" [Acts 1:18], it also specifically mentions
what act of iniquity they were talking about (ie: Acts 1:16 "...concerning
Judas who was guide to those who arrested Jesus.").  Now I would point out
that when the Bible describes an act of "iniquity," and then immediately
discusses "*the* reward of iniquity," it would be rather inane to suggest that
it was an action of iniquity other than the one discussed."
 
MY REPLY...
Dave, we are getting somewhere, aren't we!
 
ACT 1:15 And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples
(altogether the number of names was about a hundred and twenty), and said,
ACT 1:16 "Men and brethren, this Scripture had to be fulfilled, which the Holy
Spirit spoke before by the mouth of David concerning Judas, who became a guide
to those who arrested Jesus;
ACT 1:17 "for he was numbered with us and obtained a part in this ministry."
ACT 1:18 (Now this man purchased a field with the wages of iniquity; and
falling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all his entrails gushed out.
ACT 1:19 And it became known to all those dwelling in Jerusalem; so that field
is called in their own language, Akel Dama, that is, Field of Blood.)
ACT 1:20 "For it is written in the book of Psalms: 'Let his dwelling place be
desolate, And let no one live in it'; and, 'Let another take his office.'
 
Notice that in verse 16, the word "iniquity" is not used.  Rather, it states
that Judas "became a guide to those who arrested Jesus".
But the writer DID NOT stop there...vs. 17, "for he was numbered with us and
obtained a part in this ministry."  What part did Judas play in their ministry?
         ^^^^^^
JOH 12:6 This he said, not that he cared for the poor, but because he was a
thief, and had the money box; and he used to take what was put in it.
JOH 13:29 For some thought, because Judas had the money box, that Jesus had
said to him, "Buy those things we need for the feast," or that he should give
something to the poor.
 
So, now we know what part Judas played - he was a treasurer, per se.
Right after Peter stated that Judas played a part in this ministry (treasurer,
according to John), THEN Luke adds the parenthetical explanation of "wages of
iniquity" - money that should have been put into the ministry, but was stolen
by Judas to purchase a field.  I believe this is a better exegetical
explanation of what the "wages of iniquity" are.  What do you think, Dave?

Seems to me that the driver was driving the vehicle visually impaired.
Isn't that like not scraping ice and snow off your windshield and such?

Say, that's another thing that bugs me.  Why don't people scrape their
damn windows?  I've seen people driving cars with *barely* the driver's
half of the windshield cleared.  Nothing else cleared.  This seems
pretty stupid and isn't there something (probably varies state to state)
that says a certain percentage of the glass must be clear?  Oh, well.

When the utility gave up on that Cinnci, OH plant (Zimmer?) and
announced they were going to convert it to a coal-fired scheme, the
turbines were already in place, and they were the low-temp type. So the
plan was: Install a SECOND set of high temp turbines, and feed the
low-temp ones with the output of the new ones.

Never saw anything more on this. Did they ever really build it?

Canada's GST is collected as a sales tax and is considered a VAT.
Funnily, the previous hidden wholesale tax that it replaces was
never referred to as a tax (or, people never paid mind to it,
thus the uproar when it was brought up front as the GST --- 
one party has actually campaigned on hiding the tax again).

The stated intent of the Tories was to use the GST to write down
our deficit.  Unfortunately, their legislation didn't include any
mechanism for disbursing the collected funds in such a manner and
the money is now sitting in escrow.  I don't know what is involved
in releasing the funds, but one dilemna is that the Tories are not
fiscal conservatives themselves though while taxing and spending,
they've made moves to apply the breaks to a runaway locomotive by
the end of this time --- the end of their second term (~9 years).
While they do have chances of getting a third term, catching up
in the polls to their more moderate/slightly leftish pro-business
rivals, the Liberals (as in Euro/UK), the Tories' heir-apparent 
for the leaders' mantle has been termed a clone of Hillary 
Clinton ...

You can't knock a threaded stud out from its hole without destroying 
the threads.  Also part of the stud would still be in the hole. 
Therefore the stud was *not* in the hole before you touched something

You're assuming that their normal rotation carries all areas of the surface
into sunlight.  Not so.  Even on Earth, each pole gets several weeks without
sunlight in mid-winter.  Pluto and Charon have much more extreme axial
tilt and a much longer orbit.  Pluto's north pole, for example, gets over
a century of darkness followed by over a century of perpetual light.

At the moment, we're in luck -- Pluto and Charon are just past their
equinox, when the Sun was just on the horizon at both poles (of each).
If we get probes there soon, only the immediate vicinity of one pole
(on each) will be in long-term shadow.  This will get steadily worse the
longer we wait.

There are a number of other factors that are very important, the three
biggest being air velocity, air momentum and shock waves.
Velocity stacks have been used for years and are now being used inside
of stock airboxes on a number of bikes.  At a tuned engine rpm, the
stacks can greatly increase the speed, and thus momentum of the air
rushing in.
Air momentum is critical in getting good air intake: the momentum of
the air stack outside the combustion chamber will force its way inside
long after the piston has begun its compressive up-stroke.
Shock waves are used to induce air intake and to prevent fresh air from
escaping out the exzhaust ports.  Shock waves are the product of expansion
chambers or any other means of presenting a 'wall' (opening or closing)
to the air in motion.  Beyond this I am lost in the mystery of how they
design for shock waves.

Hey all:

I just moved to NYC and wondered if there are any electronics hackers
out there who could point me to places in NYC that sell individual
electronic components (switches, pots, transformers, caps,
transistors, etc.)  "Radio Shack" doesn't count (they have almost no
selection, and their prices are outrageous!)

I have particular interest in audio components (amplifier IC's, power
MOSFETS, output transformers, tubes and tube sockets, pan pots,
faders, etc.)

I have checked out a lot of 48th street and Canal street so far with
no luck.  Am I missing places, looking in the wrong place, or do I
have to resort to mail order?

   Probably because you have yet to respond to the refutation I've posted.
   Teel, it's bad enough you post this bs, it's even worse that you don't
   even try to defend it when it gets torn to pieces, but then posting
   that no one's looked at it and gloating when all facts point to the
   contrary point to a severely deluded mind.

What I found interesting about Conklin's letter is the 
6 cases he has won against the IRS.  Now, assuming that
these cases really exist and were one by him (anyone checked?)
they may have nothing to do with his major tax claim.  The IRS fought
one of his deductions.   Defending your deductions seems puny when
you believe that there is no need to file in the first place!

HIGHSPEED  ANALOG-DIGITAL PC-BOARD

Hello LAdies and Gentleman !

I am looking for a highspeed A/D PC-Board with a sampling rate above 250 MHz an a
resolution of 8-bit. The sampling rate can be arranged by an interleave mode where
the time equivalent sampling yields 2, 4 or 8 times higher sampling rate than
the A/D-Converter uses in non interleave mode.

The board must content an A/D-Converter similar to Analog Devices AD 9028 or 
AD 9038 or if available a faster on.

If you a PC-Board (16-bit slot, ISA) with this specification or better, please
send me an EMail

hansch@cdc2.ikph.uni-hannover.dbp.de

or a Telefax to: ++49 / 511 / 7629353


Thanks in advance for your help !

Sincerely

Just a shot here, but ya never know:

I once bought a (REAL) cheap equalizer / power amp for my car tape player 
at one of those motel-room truckload sales, and it sounded great.  For a 
while, that is.  Then one channel quit entirely.  I opened it up, and the 
amplifier chip for the bad channel had simply melted some of its solder 
joints attaching it to the PCB.  I soldered them back and it worked fine.  
I just had to keep the volume a bit lower than I did before.  Probably 
lousy heat sinking.

You said "a nice Alpine" which I'm sure is a few orders of mag higher
in quality than the P.O.S. I had.  But the point is - look inside before
you scrap it, since you OCCASIONALLY find something you can repair.
Maybe even the same thing I found.

Good luck!


Here is a different viewpoint.

In practice there is little difference in quality but more care is needed 
with inkjet because smudges etc. can happen.

A cheap laser printer does not manage that sort of throughput and on top of 
that how long does the _first_ sheet take to print? Inkjets are faster than 
you say and in both cases the computer often has trouble keeping up with the 
printer. (I have a 486/33 and a lot of drivers cannot keep up with the 
printer)

A sage said to me: "Do you want one copy or lots of copies?", "One", 
"Inkjet".

Paper cost is the same and both can use refills. Long term the laserprinter 
will need some expensive replacement parts (consumables) and on top of that 
are the amortisation costs which favour the lowest purchase cost printer.

HP inkjets understand PCL so in many cases a laserjet driver will work if the 
software package has no inkjet driver. 

There is one wild difference between the two printers: a laserprinter is a 
page printer whilst an inkjet is a line printer. This means that a 
laserprinter can rotate graphic images whilst an inkjet cannot. Few drivers 
actually use this facility.
(there is also the matter of downloadable fonts and so on)

Personnally, I don't know, but I'd like to try it sometime.

Programmatically, yes, we can land an Orbiter with a 5 cm hole in
the wall -- provided that the thing which caused 5 cm hole didn't
cause a Crit 1 failure on some of the internal systems.  There are
a few places where a 5 cm hole would cause a Bad Day -- especially
if the 5 cm hole went all the way through the Orbiter and out the
other side, as could easily happen with a meteor strike.  But a
hole in the pressure vessel would cause us to immediately de-orbit
to the next available landing site.

Again, you missed Jesus's point.  If you read the surrounding passages
you would understand what Jesus means by "life in the world."  But
as is, you bumbled around, asserted your standard axiom that the Bible is bunk,
and came up with the wrong idea.  Also, you do not know exactly
what Jesus means by eternal life.  

Brian K., do you expect to jump in the middle of the quantum mechanics
book and understand Hermite polynomials having not read the surrounding
material?  Why do you such with the Bible?  For an idea what Jesus
means by the world, look up references to it in your concordance.  For
a good description, the whole Book of Ecclesiastes is game.  For 
eternal life, check out John 17:3, John 3:15-16.  You will find that
eternal life is quite different than what you think.  Eternal life
starts NOW--an infinitely high quality of life living in fellowship
with God.

If my diety exists, you would not just cease to exist.  Jesus talks of

The truth is, is that it is not some sort of magic spell.  The truth
is is that you do not understand it, and enjoy not understanding it.

Wrong again.  Christianity is supposed to be relationship.  You

Just as I make up such places as Jericho, Jerusalem, Babylon, Corinth,
Ephesus, Susa, and such kings as Nebuchanezzar, David, Solomon,
Sennacherib, Herod, Pontius Pilate . . . .   But I guess then
that you treat Abraham Lincoln as a myth like you do Odin and Zeus.

No one is questioning whether Mr. King is black.  The question arises
whether King's race should make police officers "afraid as hell."  Your
statement seems to imply that cops should have a different standard for
large black guys than for just large guys in general.  

That two posts later you don't understand why anyone pointed out your use
of the adjective is almost as informative as your original use.

Gee fred.  After your bitter defense of 20 KHz power as a Basic technology
for SSF, Id think you would support a minor research program like this.

And does anyone who knows more Particle physics then me,  know if the IPNS

It may also help there is political gridlock on the entire
nuclear technical agenda.  There were big political opponenents to
Fast Breeder Technologies.  WIPP is being fought to death in Courts.
Even if you could make a nuclear incinerator, do you really think
even Deaf SMith County Nevada would accept it?  NIMBY'ism rules
nuclear power concerns.  Only the medical community has been
able to overrule  nuclear  technology opposition.

Are any of the inputs to the chip coming from TTL?  Standby-drain specs
for CMOS chips typically apply only if inputs are pulled all the way down
to zero or all the way up to Vcc.  TTL isn't good at doing the former and
it won't do the latter at all without help from pullup resistors.  This
sort of thing can easily multiply power consumption by a considerable
factor, because the CMOS transistors that are supposed to be OFF aren't
all the way hard OFF.

Sure, I can. The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Motorcycles, edited by Erwin 
Tragatsch, was published by The Hamlyn Publishing Group Limited, 
Astronaut House, Hounslow Road, Feltham, Middlesex, England.

It was first published in 1977, and mine was reprinted in 1978. Cost then 
was Pounds 5.95 in the UK, though I paid 18.50 for it in Canadian 
dollars. I have no idea whether it's still in print. Perhaps you could 
let the net know.

	Yes there is.  Not common for CB.  The pattern is different (sort of

	Use of anything under 1/4 wave for transmitting is very uncommon.  (The

Probably, law enforcement people (Park Service Police and D.C. cops),
who will use aerial photographs and extrapolate based on the
density of the crowd in small regions.

These sort of techniques derive from Army Intelligence and CIA
methods of estimating troop strength, and tend to be
methodologically skewed to always come up with inflated numbers,
so as to justify bigger budgets.

"Space: Teaching's Newest Frontier"
Sponsored by the Planetary Studies Foundation

The Planetary Studies Foundation is sponsoring a one week class for
teachers called "Space: Teaching's Newest Frontier." The class will be
held at the Sheraton Suites in Elk Grove, Illinois from June 14 through
June 18. Participants who complete the program can earn two semester
hours of graduate credit from Aurora College. Please note that while the
class is intended for teachers, it is not restricted to teachers.

The class, which is being cosponsored by the United States Space
Foundation, will teach how to use space exploration as a teaching tool
to get students excited about learning and interested in science.

Classroom topics to be covered by the class include:
     > Living in Space
     > The Space Shuttle
     > The Space Station
     > NASA Spinoffs that Benefit Society
     > Principles of Astrodynamics/Aeronautics
     > The Solar System

There will also be simulated Zero-G training in an underwater space
station simulation, model rocket launches, observing sessions at the
Harper College Observatory, and field trips to the Adler Planetarium and
the Museum of Science and Industry.

Featured speakers include Jerry Brown of the Colorado based United
States Space Foundation and Debbie Brown of the NASA Lewis Research
Center in Cleveland, Ohio. Additional instructors will be provided by
the Planetary Studies Foundation.

The social highlight of the class will be a dinner banquet featuring
Space Shuttle Payload Specialist Byron Lichtenberg, currently President
of Payload Systems, Inc. Lichtenberg was a member of the crew of STS-9
which flew in November 1983. The banquet is scheduled for Thursday, June
17.

The registration fee includes transportation for field trips, materials,
continental breakfasts, lunches, and the special dinner banquet. Guest
tickets for the dinner banquet are also available.  There is an
additional charge to receive the two hours of graduate credit. For any
additional information about the class, contact the Science Learning
Center at (708) 359-7913.

Where does this "Most Bible studying Christians think as Frank
does" come from.  And what implied "good" are you doing for other
Christians?

At least some of what you are teaching has been demonstrated as
wrong.  Has it ever occured to you that you may be doing more harm
than good to your fellow Christians?

BTW, I used to think like Frank does.  I went to a fundamentalist
church for a while.  I didn't start to really think about what
they were saying until I noticed a "God's Science" phamphlet
there.  I read it and noticed that the authors of it knew virtually
nothing about Science.  I asked church members some questions about
"theories" from the phamphlet and got only deceptive answers.  I
began to notice a very similar style of "answers" for theological
questions as well.  The only conclusion I could reach was that
these peoples' beliefs about the Bible were about as valid as
their beliefs in their God's Science phamphlet.

If one of the primary purposes of Christians is to seek out truth,
how can people condemn you for doing this?

 I hate to  admit this but there does seem to be some sort of twisted logic

Pardon me for interrupting, but why doesn't anyone ever bring up other
possibilities besides more government, less government, or no government
and stop there? It seems to me that the problems with society go MUCH
deeper than government. Democracies seem to reflective of the majority
of society, both the good and the bad. If you take away the government,
you still have the structural flaws in society, except this time, with
no restraints. Yes? No?
	Why doesn't anybody ever discuss communal society, like a
kibbutz? I never studied it on depth, but from what I've heard, the kibbutz
in Isreal was very successful. It is also very close to what Aristotle
and Socrates believed was the best.
	Sorry to detract from the discussion.

But what good is change if there is no tracable improvement in the human
condition? Who would ever support the change if you tell them it won't 
improve their lives? I know that there are, and will be, libertarians 
who will jump in now and say that it WILL improve our lives. I can deal
with that. All I'm saying is that improving the human condition must
be the PRIMARY goal of any organization.

As many people have mentioned, there is no reason why insurers could not
offer a contract without abortion services for a different premium.
The problem is that there is no guarantee that this premium would be
lower for those who chose this type of contract.  Although you are
removing one service, that may have feedbacks into other types of covered
care which results in a net increase in actuarial costs.

For an illustrative example in the opposite direction, it may be possible
to ADD services to an insurance contract and REDUCE the premium.  If you
add preventative services and this reduces acute care use, then the total
premium may fall.

Yes, I know it sounds crazy. Call it an urge. Call it what you want.
Just don't ask why :-)

Anyway, I'd like to build a UV flashlight, cheaply. "flashlight" means
it should be reasonably portable, but could have a power pack if
necessary.

My main question is the bulb: where can I get UV bulbs? Do they
need a lot of power? etc., etc.

I'm not too concerned with whether it's long-wave or short-wave
(but hey, if anyone has a cheap source of bulbs, I'll take both).

One other thing: a friend of mine mentioned something about near-UV
light being cheaper to get at than actual UV light. Does anyone
know what he was referring to?

Thanks much.

	You can forget this line of reasoning.  When an animal

something to do with their genetics.  I was putting along at a
mere 20mph or so, gravel road with few loose rocks on it (as in,
just like bad concrete), and 2200lbs of swinging beef jumped a
fence, came out of the ditch, and rammed me!  When I saw her jump
the fence I went for the gas, since she was about 20 feet ahead
of me but a good forty to the side.  Damn cow literally chased me
down and nailed me.  No damage to cow, a bent case guard and a
severely annoyed rider were the only casualties.  If I had my
shotgun I'd still be eating steak.  Nope, if 2200lbs of cow
can hit me when I'm actively evading, forget a much more
manueverable dog.  Just run them over.

I assume that can only be guessed at by the assumed energy of the
event and the 1/r^2 law.  So, if the 1/r^2 law is incorrect (assume
some unknown material [dark matter??] inhibits Gamma Ray propagation),
could it be possible that we are actually seeing much less energetic
events happening much closer to us?  The even distribution could
be caused by the characteristic propagation distance of gamma rays 
being shorter then 1/2 the thickness of the disk of the galaxy.

Here is a computation I did a long time ago that computes the length

======================================================================
Definitions:

z = the tilt of the axis of the planet away from the normal to its
orbital plane.  In case of the Earth z is about 23.5 degrees, I think.
I do not recall the exact value.  In case of Uranus, z is almost
90 degrees.

u = latitude of the location where the length of the day is measured.
Paris is at about 45 degrees.  North pole is at 90.

a = angular position of the planet around the sun.  As a goes from
0 to 360 degrees, the planet makes a full circle around the sun.
The spring equinox occurs at a=0.

L = daylight fraction = (duration of daylight)/(duration of a full day).
On the equator (u=0) L is always 1/2.  Near the north pole (u=90 degrees)
L is sometimes one and sometimes zero, depending on the time of the year.

Computation:
Define the auxiliary angles p and q by:
sin p = sin a sin z
cos q = h ( tan u tan p ),       (0 < q < 180 degrees)

Conclusion:
L = q / 180   (if q is measured in degrees)
L = q / pi    (if q is measured in radians)

Wait!  But what is h?
The cutoff function h is defined as follows:

h (s) = s    if  |s| < 1
      = 1    if   s > 1
      = -1   if   s < 1

As an interesting exercise, plot L versus a.   The graph will shows
how the length of the daylight varies with the time of the year.
Experiment with various choices of latitudes and tilt angles.
Compare the behavior of the function at locations above and below
the arctic circle.

I recently bought an apparantly complete Expansion Chassis by Mountain
Computer Inc.  It consists of a box with 8 Apple ][+ compatible slots,
powersupply brick, interface card and ribbon cable to attach it to the computer
to be expanded.  There was also included a small card with empty sockets on top
and pins on the bottom that looks like it would plug into the ][+ motherboard
somewhere after pulling a chip.  There's an empty socket also on the interface
card and a short 16-pin DIP jumper like the ones used with ][+ language cards.
 
This technological marvel came with no docs and I haven't a clue as how to hook
this thing up.  If anyone has docs and/or users disk of any sort for this I
could really use copies of them or at least some help.
 
I need to know:
 
o How to orient the ribbon cable between the card and the chassis.
o How to attach the short cable from the motherboard to the card
  and if the small card is used.
o The purposes of the various jumper-pins on the card (it has more

How could this possibly be "environmental vandalism" when there is no
"environment" to vandalize up there?

Since the advertising "is just to help defray costs", it's certainly no
surprise that "the taxpayers would bear most of the expense".  Sounds
like a good idea to me, since the taxpayers would bear _all_ of the
expense if they didn't do the advertising.

Great idea, they should have done it long ago.

>What about light pollution in observations? (I read somewhere else that

I can't believe that a mile-long billboard would have any significant
effect on the overall sky brightness.  Venus is visible during the day,
but nobody complains about that.  Besides, it's in LEO, so it would only
be visible during twilight when the sky is already bright, and even if
it would have some miniscule impact, it would be only for a short time
as it goes zipping across the sky.

>Are protesting groups being organized in the States?

No doubt.  People are always looking for something to protest about, so
it would be no surprise.

>Really, really depressed.

Well, look on the, er, bright side.  Imagine the looks on the faces of
people in primitive tribes out in the middle of nowhere as they look up

You could argue that if you wanted, but I think a more reasonable 
argument would point out the fact that the remembrance feast was
very similar to the Pesach (Passover) meal during Seder, a very
Jewish ritual.
 
The fact that there appears to be an abuse in the early Church of
people eating too much (a very real concern with some Passover meals)
and not treating the meal with respect, shows the simplifying of the
ritual to just bread and wine to be a way of dealing with the
inherent problems of people's human nature, and trying to keep the
essentials of the remembrance aspects.

  Nut or not, he was clearly a liar.  He said he would surrender after
  local radio stations broadcast his message, but he didn't.  Then he
  said he would surrender after Passover, but he didn't.

  None of which excuses the gross incompetence and disregard for the

  probably have seen more restraint.

Hi,
    I was reading through "The Spaceflight Handbook" and somewhere in
there the author discusses solar sails and the forces acting on them
when and if they try to gain an initial acceleration by passing close to
the sun in a hyperbolic orbit. The magnitude of such accelerations he
estimated to be on the order of 700g. He also says that this is may not
be a big problem for manned craft because humans (and this was published
in 1986) have already withstood accelerations of 45g. All this is very
long-winded but here's my question finally - Are 45g accelerations in
fact humanly tolerable? - with the aid of any mechanical devices of
course. If these are possible, what is used to absorb the acceleration?
Can this be extended to larger accelerations?

Thanks is advance...

Refer to patents by JAMES HARRIS ROGERS:
958,829; 1,220,005; 1,322,622; 1,349,103; 1,315,862; 1,349,104;
1,303,729; 1,303,730; 1,316,188

He details methods of underground and underwater wireless communications.
For a review, refer to _Electrical_Experimenter_, March 1919 and June 1919.

Rogers' methods were used extensively during the World War, and was
unclassified after the war. Supposedly, the government rethought this
soon after, and Rogers was convieniently forgotten.

The bottom line is that all antennas that are grounded send HALF of
their signal THRU the ground. The half that travels thru space is
quickly dissapated (by the square of the distance), but that which
travels thru the ground does not disapate at all. Furthermore,
the published data showed that when noise drowned out regular
reception, the underground antennas would recieve virtually noise-free.

IF you find this hard to believe, then refer to the work of the
man who INVENTED wireless: Tesla. Tesla confirmed that Rogers' methods
were correct, while Hertzian wave theory was completely "abberant".

This group killed itself to fulfill its interpretation of prophecy
and to book a suite in Paradise, taking innocent kids along for the
ride. I hardly think the feds were motivated by persecution. If they
were, all Koresh would have had to do was surrender quietly to the
authorities, without firing a shot, to get the American people behind
him and put the feds in the hot seat. But no, God told him to play
the tough guy. There's great strength in yielding, but few appreciate
this.

NOT ALL PARALLEL PORTS ARE BI-DIRECTIONAL WITHOUT MODIFICATION.

My experience with the standard old zenith parallel port in their 
original 286s proves that.  They had the input direction disactiviated by 
tieing them R/W select line of the circuit to Vcc.  To make it bi ( which 
I did ) I had to modify it by scraping off the trace and solder a jump to 
the proper location.  I thought that this was just lazy on the part of 
Zenith ( they were not Zenith-Bull Group at that time).

How can you lie about something that no one knows for sure.  I am the first
to state that the 10% figure may be too high- but it may just be too low,
depending on what you are talking about.

Keep in mind that there are 'practicing' heterosexuals that are actually
gay.  These people chose to take a road that avoids being harassed and
they wanted to 'fit-in' with everyone other 'normal' person.

But let's get off of this irrational behavior of calling everyone a liar,
you cannot even start to support such claims.

I really didn't mean to imply that my Ninja was any better than a Duc.  
I have to talked to a few Duc owners (750SS owners in particular) who
say that the power is something less than overwhelming.  That said,
I would love to have a 900SS.  I guess I should have been a bit more
specific.  If you have something that weighs that same as the 750, go 
for the extra cubes.  

I think that fact that I own a GTV-6 shows that I don't care about maximum
power (it's no slug though) to the exclusion of everything else.  The note 
and the handling are more important to me.  I just bought a Ninja because I 
couldn't afford a Duc.

Didn't mean to ruffle any feathers, I'll probably be getting a 900SS next
year...

There's this minor thing called "interest of finality/repose".  What
it means is that parties aren't dragged into court over and over again
because the losing side "discovers" some "new" evidence.  I don't know
about you, Brett, but I suspect GM had the resources to find just
about as many expert and fact witnesses as it wanted before the trial
started.  Letting them re-open the case now is practically an
invitation to every civil litigant on earth to keep an ace in the hole
in case the verdict goes against him.

BTW, in federal criminal cases, Rule 33 does permit a motion for a new
trial "based on . . . *newly discovered* evidence" if made within 2
years of the verdict.  (Emphasis mine.)  If you're trying to make a
backhanded point about criminal justice in a discussion that has
little to do with criminal trials -- as the estimable David Brock did
in his amusing WSJ piece last week -- save your breath.

Unless there's some reason to believe that this supposed bias predated
the trial (as opposed to being a product of it), and that GM was
unfairly prevented from discovering it (by venireman concealment or
otherwise), why should GM be allowed to complain?

I missed the first part of this thread; are you switching line level or
speaker level audio?
If line level, there's a single chip 4x1 *stereo* audio switch available
that switches 4 two-channel inputs into 1 two-channel output, and also
has a mute function, all controllable with ttl inputs.  LM1037, I think?

If speaker level, never mind.  :(

Well, a student body president can't exactly campaign on the stand
that he's "tough on crime".  Their job is to listen to what people want
and fund things that make sense.

Condoms and marijuana aren't exactly the worst things to have available
either...

What do you mean? Are you saying they thought the effort was
profitable or that the money was efficiently spent (providing max
value per money spent)?

I think they would answer yes on ballance to both questions. Exceptions
would be places like the US from the French Indian War to the end of
the US Revolution. 

But even after the colonies revolted or where given independance the
British engaged in very lucrative trading with the former colonies.
Five years after the American Revolution England was still the largest
US trading partner.

Actually, that is no longer true. In the last few years Congress has
ammended laws to provide whatever is needed. Note that both Spacehab
and Comet are funded this way.

The problems aren't legal nor technical. The problem is NASA's culture.

The Selective Service Registration should be abolished.  To start with, the
draft is immoral.  Whether you agree with that or not, we don't have one now,
and military experts agree that the quality of the armed forces is superior
with a volunteer army than with draftees.  Finally, the government has us
on many lists in many computers (the IRS, Social Security Admistration and
Motor Vehicle Registries to name a few) and it can find us if it needs to.
Maintaining yet another list of people is an utter waste of money and time.
Let's axe this whole department, and reduce the deficit a little bit.

Glad to hear this, just a note, Osiris, Mithras and many other
cult gods resurrected as well, so there's a good chance for all of
us to maybe end up in a virtual reality simulator, and live forever,
hurrah!

Sorry, this was a joke, some sort of one anyway. I'm the first
that connected Osiris with a virtual reality personality database.
Time to write a book.

Even if Brett's eventual-return figures were correct -- and they
clearly weren't -- he'd still be wrong about the cause for the '86
blip because he fails to consider 2 basic factors:

1) As Ted notes, not everyone is a long-term investor.  One might find
oneself, as I did in late 1986, anticipating expenses in the near term
that require selling off holdings.  Given the choice between waiting a
few weeks (and taking an extra tax hit) or selling in December with
preferential tax treatment, only a fool would choose the former.

2) The fact that Brett can now construct _post hoc_ calculations of
what would have been more beneficial to investors is in many respects
beside the point.  There was plenty of _Money_-style advice given to
unsophisticated investors in late 1986 to "sell now and save on
taxes."  In case anyone missed it, there was no shortage of similar
advice late last year (in the NYTimes, e.g.), even though that advice
was based not on the foregone conclusion of enacted law (as in 1986),
but merely on the *assumption* that Clinton would raise tax rates
(without capping CG taxes, contrary to the current proposal).

It's nice to think that investors always behave in their optimal
economic interest.  Like assuming weightless ropes and frictionless
pulleys, though, this sort of thinking often fails to describe
accurately what happens in the real world.

(not that logic has anything to do with it, but...)
I can see the liability of putting stickers on the car while it was moving,
or something, but it's the BDI that chooses to start and then drive the car
in a known unsafe condition that would (seem to be) liable. Furthermore, they
would have had the last chance to avoid an unsafe situation, which is an
additional factor in attributing "blame".

Anyway, stickers on the window are less effective... no one has any problem
taking a blade to a window to remove a stubborn sticker, but it's a different
story with that that nice paint job on the door....

    GORE JOINS STUDENTS IN ORLANDO FOR FIRST KIDS EARTH SUMMIT
    Will Take Part in Special Town Meeting On the Environment
 ******** SATURDAY, APRIL 17, 1993 - ORLANDO, FLORIDA **********

     WASINGTON -- Joining students from across the United States 
and around the world for the first ever Kids Earth Summit, Vice 
President Al Gore will travel to Orlando, Florida, on Saturday 
(4/17) and participate in a special town hall meeting, hosted by 
Linda Ellerbee for broadcast on Nickelodeon, to hear the young 
people's concerns and share ideas about the environment.

     The Vice President will take part in the "Kids World 
Council: Plan It for the Planet" from 2-5 PM (EDT) Saturday 
(4/17) in Orlando, Florida.  He will tour a display of student 
environmental projects, then videotape the town hall meeting 
where he will discuss with student delegates their concerns about 
the environment and their plans for an environmentally sound 
future.

     The town hall meeting will be moderated by Linda Ellerbee 
and taped for a news special, "Nickelodeon Special Edition:  Plan 
It for the Planet," which will air on Sunday, April 18 at 8 PM 
(EDT).  It is sponsored by Nickelodeon and the Children's Earth 
Fund.

     "Young people care about the environment because they know 
it affects our future.  Across the country and around the world, 
young people are speaking out about the environmental challenges 
we face.  They are identifying problems, thinking about 
solutions, and they are demanding action from their leaders," the 
Vice President said.

     The Kids World Council delegates are meeting for three days 
in Orlando to discuss how to save energy and switch to renewable 
energy.  They will be following the format and goals of the Earth 
Summit that took place last year in Rio de Janeiro.  The Vice 
President led the Senate Delegation to the Earth Summit.

     "I look forward to hearing what young people have to say 
about the environment and their future.  Their insight into the 
world around us is important," the Vice President said.

I produced an error last week about CHORION:

>> (By the way Mr DeCenso, you really should have looked in the index of your

I abhor publishing trash (I abhor it of myself even more than I do from
others, but since I do not present myself as an authority on the subject, I do
not feel dishonest, though I do openly admit ignorance and incompetence in
this example).  Thus I felt honor bound to do a better set of research
specifically on the word.  First it should be noted that Greek grammar is not
as tough as I first assumed (it is not nontrivial by any means, and I still am
not competent with it, but it is not as opaque as I had thought).  It turns
out that while the Index for the Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich "Greek Lexicon" renders
each verse in order, each word within a verse is put in greek alphabetical
order.  Thus while the the meaning of the verse is decipherable, the syntax is
far from clear.  On the other hand, a Greek-English Intralinear Bible makes
things a lot more comprehendable.  And yes, the word for field in Acts 1:18 is
indeed "chorion." 

Now I've checked several Greek-English lexicons:

	"Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament," Louw and Nida
	"Robinson's Greek and English Lexicon of the New Testament"
	"Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament," Grimm
	"Word study Concordance," Tynsdale
	"A Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament and other 
	 early Christian Writings," Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich
	"The New Analytical Greek Lexicon," Perschbacher

In each case the meaning of the word Chorion was given variously as:

	A space, place, region, district, field, area, "country place," 
	land, farm, estate, "a bit of tillage", and similar meanings.

Nowhere do any of these books mention anything about "grave." As some of these 
books go into great detail, I would be very surprised to find that these books 
are all inadequate and Mr Archer is the only competent scholar in Greek.  I 
think it more likely that Mr Archer's investigations into "contradictions" to 
be once again, as your friend said it, "lacking in substance," and thus Archer 
is again shown worthless as an expert witness (By the way Mr DeCenso, I would 
have honorably presented my results on this matter, even if I had found them
to support Mr Archer's contentions). 

By the way, among these lexicons, (eg: Robinson's) is the definition of
"agros," the word used in Matthew 27 to describe the field bought.  The word
"agros" is defined as "a field in the country." Chorion is specifically noted
as a synonym to agros.  This is significant, as it is evidence of how silly
Bullinger's exegisis was, which stated that the word for "field" in Matthew
(ie: agros) is different from the word for "field" in Acts (ie: chorion), and
thus we must be talking about two different fields (Of course you already
admit how stupid Bullinger's exegisis is, but this was a small serendipity
which drives the point home). 

So as of now, unless Mr DeCenso show compelling reasons to believe otherwise
(eg: a reputable scholar with reputable references), I consider this 
particular issue closed.  See Mr DeCenso, now you can go on to answer
questions about the denials of Peter, the day of the Crucifixion, Tyre, and 
the fact that the author of Matthew quoted from the wrong prophet in
discussing the "Potter's Field."

Actually, I think J. Chiu knows the score and is just being
silly. However, "decibel" is in fact 1/10th of a bel. He is
right on that one, but I don't know if it was accidental or not.

Strictly defined, a bel is the ratio of the log of two power levels,
and a decibel is 1/10th of a bel so you have 10X decibels for every bel,
hence bel=log(P2/P1) and decibel=10Xlog(P2/P1).

The bel, ohm, volt, farad, ampere, watt, hertz, henry, etc. are
all named for pioneers in the field. It's a traditional and fine
way to honor researchers who discover new knowledge in a new field.
Hertz was one of the most important of the early electronics explorers,
but had been left out in having a term or unit named after him
until recently, (1960's, prior to that what is now a hertz was a cps.)
All the other units were defined many decades earlier.

Hum, do you enjoy putting words in my mouth? 
Come to Nome and meet some of these miners.. I am not sure how things go down
south in the lower 48 (I used to visit, but), of course to believe the
media/news its going to heck (or just plain crazy). 
Well it seems that alot of Unionist types seem to think that having a job is a
right, and not a priviledge. Right to the same job as your forbearers, SEE:
Kennedy's and tel me what you see (and the families they have married into).
There is a reason why many historians and poli-sci types use unionist and
socialist in the same breath.
The miners that I know, are just your average hardworking people who pay there
taxes and earn a living.. But taxes are not the answer. But maybe we could move
this discussion to some more appropriate newsgroup..

I had knee surgery while I was in the Navy back in 77.  The 
doctors put me in a cast from ass-to-ankle.  My only method of transportaion 
was a DOHC 450 Honda at the time.  I found that by sliding back on the seat 
I could use my heel (did I mention it was my left leg?) to operate the shift.
I would hook the end of the lever with my heel and lift my entire leg for up-
shifts and just drop my leg on the lever for the down-shifts.  Forget 
nutral, took WAY too much finesse for the leg!  The crutches were bungee-
corded to the right side of the bike with the "top" resting on the passenger 
peg and the right turnsignal sticking through the "hole" in the crutches.  
Every other day when I rode the 10 miles to Physical Therapy (tourture 
sessions) the doc would give me hell about riding a bike much less riding in 
my condition.  Didn't stop me tho! B-P

BTW.  This is the same bike I assembled in my second floor barracks room and 
rode down the stairs when it was completed!

Several people have enquired about the availability of the book about the
Great 72" reflector built at Birr Castle, Ireland in 1845 which remained the
largest in the world until the the start of the 20th century.

"The Astronomy of Birr Castle" was written by Patrick Moore who now sits on
the committee which is going to restore the telescope. (The remains are on
public display all year round - the massive support walls, the 60 foot long
tube, and other bits and pieces). This book is the definitivie history of
how one man, the Third Earl of Rosse, pulled off the most impressive
technical achievement, perhaps ever, in the history of the telescope, and
the discoveries made with the instrument.

Patrick Moore is donating all proceeds from the book's sale to help restore
the telescope. Astronomy Ireland is making the book available world wide by
mail order. It's a fascinating read and by ordering a copy you bring the day
when we can all look through it once again that little bit nearer.

Does anyone know what causes the ever-growing black border around the
edges of my computer screen?  The growth has been gradual so I don't
know how long it's taken to get this bad.  I have a 19" DEC (?)
color monitor, maybe five years old, and the black border is about 1.1
inches on the left and right sides, about 1.75 inches on the bottom and
negligible at the top of the screen.  The only controls are
brightness knob, contrast knob, deGauss switch, and power switch.

Is there anything to be done, or are the monitor's days numbered?

Yo--earth to Clayton--*my* philosophy?  I have never discussed this with you.
I know it's a minor point, but, gee, dude, you have no idea what economic

(a) Just when and where have I encouraged people not to be responsible
for themselves?  Be specific--but do make up random dates and heinous
acts as you see fit.

(b) You and I have encouraged many people to do many things.  How does that
in any way make our audiences less responsible for their actions?  Is there
a finite amount of responsibility, so (cf. conservation of energy) as
I become more responsible for an occurrence by encouraging it the actual
perpetrator becomes correspondingly less so?  At what point does the
perpetrator become completely innocent altogether?  You know, this lends
a whole new meaning to the term "the moral high ground".

I don't doubt it, but unless you can show me statistics to the contrary
I will persist in my apparently dogmatic socialist belief (hey, if *you* say

If the free market places an attractive price on the screwing in of a

most certainly get screwed in -- and most promptly at that, too.

and/or ordering system. THere is what may be an HPIB connector on the back. When
I power it up, the front panel power light comes on, but no activity, and the
door doesn't open. Anyone have any experience with this unit or any ideas on how
to obtain documentation?

Do they have a history of working in massage parlors, and telling

	Don't just nab it, POUNCE on it.  These are fairly rare bikes, and
they are MORE than adequate for putting a big brown stripe in your shorts.
Does a 50mph power wheelie appeal to you?  I thought it would...

Other idea for old space crafts is as navigation beacons and such..
Why not?? If you can put them on "safe" "pause" mode.. why not have them be
activated by a signal from a space craft (manned?) to act as a naviagtion
beacon, to take a directional plot on??

Wierd or what?

Henry, I made the assumption that he who gets there firstest with the mostest

Ohhh, you want to put in FINE PRINT which says "Thou shall do wonderous R&D
rather than use off-the-shelf hardware"? Sorry, didn't see that in my copy.
Most of the Pournellesque proposals run along the lines of <some dollar
amount> reward for <some simple goal>.  

You go ahead and do your development, I'll buy off the shelf at higher cost (or
even Russian; but I also assume that there'd be some "Buy US" provos in there)
and be camped out in the Moon while you are launching and assembling little
itty-bitty payloads in LEO with your laser or gas gun.  And working out the
bugs of assembly & integration in LEO. 

Oh, hey, could I get a couple of CanadARMs tuned for the lunar environment?  I
wanna do some teleoperated prospecting while I'm up there...

     What  evidence  indicates that Gamma Ray bursters are very far away?

Their distribution is very isotropic and the intensity distribution,
crudely speaking, indicates we're seeing an edge to the distribution.

   Given the enormous  power,  i was just wondering,  what if they are
   quantum  black holes or something  like that  fairly close by?

   Why would they have to be at  galactic ranges?   

Now, in the good old days before GRO data, it was thought the
gamma bursters were neutron stars in the galaxy, it was expected that
GRO would confirm this by either showing they were a local population
(within a few hundred light years) or that they were in the galactic
halo. (Mechanism was not known but several plausible ones existed)
(also to be fair it was noted that the _brightest_ burster was
probably in the LMC, suggesting theorists might be wrong back then...)
	As the Sun is not at the center of the galaxy a halo
population should show anisotropy (a local disk population is
ruled out completely at this stage) - to avoid the anisotropy you
have to push the halo out, the energy then gets large, the mechanism
of getting NS out that far becomes questionable, and we should start
to see for example the Andromeda's bursters.
	The data is consistent with either a Oort cloud distribution
(but only just) - but no one can think of a plausible source with
the right spectrum. Or, it can be a cosmological distances (hence
isotropy) and the edge is "the edge of the Universe" ;-)
If at cosmological distances you need very high energy (to detect)
and a very compact source (for spectrum), ergo a neutron star
colliding with another neutron star or black hole. Even then getting
the spectrum is very hard, but conceivable.

	If we know anything about physics at that level,
the bursters are not due to quantum black holes or cosmic
strings, wrong spectrum for one thing.

The situation is further complicated by recent claims that
there are two classes of sources ;-)  [in the colliding NS
they'd actually probably fit relatively easily into the
NS-NS and NS-BH collision scenarios respectively]

   my own pet theory is that it's  Flying saucers  entering
   hyperspace :-)

   but the reason i am asking is that most everyone assumes  that they
   are  colliding nuetron stars  or  spinning black holes,  i just wondered
   if any mechanism could exist  and place them  closer in.

If you can think of one, remember to invite me to Stockholm...

The Apollo fire was harsh, A Saturn V explosion would have been

been *the* technological turning point for the US turning us
from Today's "We can do anything, we're *the* Super Power" to a much more

I speulate that:

When I was at the Texas Star Party a few years ago, the sky was so dark
that Venus did, indeed, cause light pollution until it set.

Even if the billboard were dark it could cause a problem.  Imagine observing an

Atoms are not objective.  They aren't even real.  What scientists call
an atom is nothing more than a mathematical model that describes 
certain physical, observable properties of our surroundings.  All
of which is subjective.  

What is objective, though, is the approach a scientist 
takes in discussing his model and his observations.  There
is no objective science.  But there is an objective approach
which is subjectively selected by the scientist.  Objective
in this case means a specified, unchanging set of rules that
he and his colleagues use to discuss their science.

This is in contrast to your Objective Morality.  There may be an
objective approach to subjectively discuss your beliefs on
morality.  But there exists no objective morality.

Also, science deals with how we can discuss our observations of 
the physical world around us.  In that the method of discussion
is objective ( not the science; not the discussion itself ).

Science makes no claims to know the whys or even the hows sometimes
of what we can observe.  It simply gives us a way to discuss our
surroundings in a meaningful, consistent way.

I think it was Neils Bohr who said (to paraphrase) Science is what
we can _say_ about the physical world.

OK, here's at least one Christian's answer:

Jesus was a JEW, not a Christian.  In this context Matthew 5:14-19 makes
sense.  Matt 5:17 "Do not think that I [Jesus] came to abolish the Law or
the Prophets; I did not come to abolish, but to fulfill."  Jesus lived
under the Jewish law.  However, He was the culmination of the promises
of the Prophets.  He came to *fulfill* the prophecies and fully obey
God's purposes.

Verse 18 says "For truly I say to you, until heaven and earth pass
away, not the smallest letter or stroke shall pass away from the Law,
until all is accomplished."  The key to this verse IMHO is the last 
phrase.  Jesus, as the fulfillment of the law, "accomplished" what the 
Law was supposed to accomplish.  

Verse 19:  "Whoever then annuls one of the least of these commandments,
and so teaches others, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven;
but whoever keeps and teaches them, he shall be called great in the
kingdom of heaven."  Taken in the context of Jesus teaching Jewish 
people about living lives under the law, this makes sense.

In general, it appears that Jesus is responding to some criticism he 
must have received about "doing away with the Law."  That was not 
Jesus' intent at all.  He had come to earth to live the Law as it 
should be lived and fulfill the promises made by God to his 
people all the way back to Eve [Gen 3:15-The serpent will bruise your 
heel, but *He* will bruise his head.]  Jesus appeared to be "doing 
away with the Law" because he did not honor the traditions of men as 
equal to the Law of God.  He regularly locked horns with the religious 
leaders of the day because he would not conform to *their* rules, only 
God's Law.

In the Matthew passage Jesus is defending his dedication to the Law 
and defending himself against his accusors.  Almost the entire Sermon 
on the Mount (Matt. 5-7) is dedicated to helping the Jewish people 
understand the true intent of the Law, sweeping away the clutter which 
had been introduced by the Pharasees and their traditions.

In Galatians 3:23-26, Paul describes the relationship of Jesus to the 
Law in this way:

[23] But before faith came, we were kept in custody under the law, being 
shut up to the faith which was later to be revealed.  [24] Therefore 
the Law has become our tutor to lead us to Christ, that we may be 
justified by faith.  [25]  But now that faith has come, we are no 
longer under a tutor.  [26] For you are all sons of God through faith 
in Christ Jesus.

I believe this says that after Christ was revealed, the Law had 
served it's purpose, i.e. "our tutor to lead us to Christ," and
now, "we are no longer under a tutor."  The law has been "fulfilled" 
as Christ said he would do.

God, the author of the old Law, and the Christ/Man, Jesus, are the same
personality.  Therefore, the old Law and the new Testament (the "last
will and testament" of Jesus) are based on the same moral principles. 
It makes sense that many of the principles in the old Law are
re-expressed in Christianity. 

On the other hand, now that the Law has fulfilled it's purpose and 
Christians relate to God through Christ, not the Law, it also makes 
sense that new practices and new symbolisms were established to 
represent the "mysteries" of this new relationship.  i.e. Baptism 
representing Christ's death, burial, and resurrection (Rom. 6:3-8),
The Lord's supper as a memorial to His sacrifice (I Cor. 11:26), and
Sunday as a day of worship commemorating His resurrection (Matt 28:1ff,
Acts 20:7)

OK, That's one Christian's explanation.  I don't claim to have all
these issues completely settled even in my own mind and I welcome
other Christians to offer other alternatives.

Please excuse the long posting.  Thanks for your interest if you have read 
this far...

SPEAKING OF VAT:  Did anyone see CNN's report yesterday (4/15)?  It 
was quite hillarious (no pun intended).  They ran down how a percent tax
was added at each stage of manufacturing, graphicaly depicting a stack of 
quarters being added at each wholesale stage.  When they got to the final 
stage (the actual retail sale) the small stack of quarters added to the
large stack already there was said to be "the amount paid by consumers."
In other words, they completed ignored the fact that at each stage the
tax would of course be passed on to the next buyer with the retail consumer
paying the full load.

These are not journalists--they're lap dogs.

Because you are not being consistent.  Moral systems must be consistent.

It was more than a theoretical concept; it was seriously pursued by

Okay here is what I have so far:

Have a group (any size, preferibly small, but?) send a human being to the moon,
set up a habitate and have the human(s) spend one earth year on the moon. Does
that mean no resupply or ?? 

Need to find atleast $1billion for prize money.

New Mexico State has semi-challenged University of Alaska (any branch) to put a

Any other University/College/Institute of Higher Learning wish to make a

I like the idea of having atleast a russian team.

Wrong.  In better EC countries that use pure (but public) health
insurance (like we use in Canada) rather than self-enclosed HMO-like
socialized medicine, 30% of our costs comes from private supplementary
insurance and/or copayments.  France Magazine's Summer 1992 edition
has a fantastic presentation of their basic insurance coverage,
including a sample chart of copayment percentages.  For 1-30 days,
you're covered for 80% of the public hospital rate, 100% afterward.
With extra private insurance, you can get into a private hospital and
be covered for any differences beyond the public hospital rate.  The
public insurance covers 100% beyond 30 days, or the same cash amount
for a private hospital and the difference is paid out-of-pocket or
according to your supplementary private insurance.  Over 2/3rds of
French have some form of extra private insurance.  So, 30% of health
costs in Europe are out of private funds and not gleaned from other
taxes.  The GDP figures are combined public and private expenditures
for total outlay using the same methods that yield the 13-14% figure
for the U.S.

That the French had deductibles and copayments in their insurance fund
is to their credit ... I am in the minority for advocating such back
in Canada (to make the Canadian insurance look more like real health
insurance -- which actually it is).  The new Reform Party, a breakoff
of traditionalists from the Conservatives with a mildly "libertarian"
faction, hold our public health insurance as an untouchable but that
just a few people have to be reminded that it's not free (the average
Canadian/European is more fiscally naive than their American
counterparts on issues like these).

I'm one of the few people who favour copayments (forget about
leftists, even our conservatives attack me for it on the Canadian
newsgroups) to make it look more like real insurance, 'cos the 100%
insurance payment is hidden (unlike in France) and if you didn't know
it, you'd believe it actually is socialized medicine (American
conservatives/libertarians and Canadian leftists are the only ones who
seriously call it that).  Canadians aren't worried about the
Americans, who spend 14%; we're worried about the French and Germans
who spend 7% to our 9% ... so the insurance is looking at things that
shouldn't be paid for out of general funds like physicals for
insurance policies, sick notes, electrolysis, etc.  The reason that
the Canadian health insurance hasn't spiralled out of control despite
being open and universal is that unlike Americans, there is no urge to
spend all of your benefits' worth, and more if you can ... we're a
different culture.

"Managed Care" relies on HMO's, which are unknown in most western
nations that use only public health insurance like Canada, France
and Germany (I'm Canadian, and my German father-in-law-to-be says
of HMO/NHS approaches, "We left that behind with East Germany!").
Sure, HMO/NHS controls costs because you have managers strangling
doctors with budget strings.

In Canada, we use the public health insurance approach as in France
and Germany, with all private doctors and both private and public
hospitals.  It is all pure insurance without HMO's.  The divisions
are different, with the Germans using a couple hundred interlinked
"sickness funds" over a century old while Canada divides by their
provinces (who run the insurance fund and set local fees with the
doctors monopoly; federal funds cover the fees disbursed.)

With such an open-ended system, it's no surprise that Canada is #2 to
the U.S. in costs; all-insurance is the most expensive way to go. The
French and Germans use the same approach but have larger populations
in more compact geography to improve scales of economy.

    The immunization program is just a "useful first step". Among other
    things, the money will go to pay for creating and maintaning a
    a computerized "innoculation" database on all U.S. children.
    (code-named Big Mother... Just kidding, the name will be Children
    Defense Database, or something like that.)

    Once the money is spent and little or no tangible results achieved, 
    the goverment will have to start knocking down doors, in some 
    neigborhoods, and bribe parents in others (probably the ones that 
    are paying kids for attending the school - what a fantastic idea!)

Warning: There is no point in arguing who's "legit" and who's not. *WHICH*

Yes, you increase the RPM slip of a "boxer" type fan by installing
a capacitor in series with the fan's power supply.  The air flow of
small 3.5 inch fans can be reduced by about 50% by using a 1 to 4
uF capacitor.  Use a good grade nonpolarized unit with working
voltage rating around 250 volts.  Note that some impriical study is
usually required to experimentally determine the best size
capacitor for a given application.

For DC powered applications, try the Radio Shack 12 volt box fan.
It can run and start reliably from as low as about 4.5 VDC.  It is
exceptionally quiet, but at admittedly low flow.  I wish I knew who
made the fans for Radio Shack.

Of course, one again faces the question of how one circumscribes government
power (and keeps it circumscribed) in a complex society when it is in the 
interest of neither capitalists nor consumers to refrain from using 
government power for their own ends.  But apart from that little 
conundrum...

It would seem that a society with a "failed" government would be an ideal
setting for libertarian ideals to be implemented.  Now why do you suppose
that never seems to occur?...

I wouldn't call it "vague."  I'd call it elastic.  All "regulation" is 
not necessarily the same.  By opposing all government regulation, some 
libertarians treat every system from a command economy to those that
regulate relatively free markets as identical.  That's one reason
many of the rest of us find their analysis to be simplistic.

Would anyone out there in DoDland be able to help me out in giving me
a contact to purchase a pair of military air-borne combat boots (9 1/2
D in size).  These boots (so I have read here on rec.moto) are calf
height boots that use only velcro for enclosure.  I have phoned around
and nobody seems to carry such an item.  I admit I have not gone into
the deepest bowels of NYC yet for the search but I have made some
calls to several of the bigger army/navy type stores with no luck.

Anyone out there know of a place that does carry such an item as well
as does mail order?  Any help would be appreciated.

                           THE WHITE HOUSE

                    Office of the Press Secretary
______________________________________________________________
For Immediate Release                             April 15, 1993     

	     
                       REMARKS BY THE PRESIDENT
                   TO LAW ENFORCEMENT ORGANIZATIONS
	     
	     
                           The Rose Garden 


2:52 P.M. EDT


	     THE PRESIDENT:  Good afternoon.  Ladies and gentlemen, 
two months ago I presented a comprehensive plan to reduce our 
national deficit and to increase our investment in the American 
people, their jobs and their economic future.  The federal budget 
plan passed Congress in record time, and created a new sense of hope 
and opportunity in the country.  
	     
	     Then, the short-term jobs plan I presented to Congress, 
which would create a half a million jobs in the next two years passed 
the House of Representatives two weeks ago.  It now has the support 
of a majority of the United States Senate. 
	     
	     All of these members of Congress know it's time to get 
the economy moving again, to get job growth going again, to get a 
fast start on the investments we need to build a lasting prosperity.  
Unfortunately, a minority of the members of the United States Senate 
have used gridlock tactics to prevent their colleagues from working 
the will of the majority on the jobs bill.
	     
	     When Congress returns, I ask every senator from every 
state and from both parties to remember what is at stake.  The issue 
is not politics, it's people.  Sixteen million of them are looking 
for full-time jobs and can't find them.  These men and women don't 
care about who's up or down in Washington.  They care about paying 
the rent and meeting the mortgage payment, about putting food on the 
table and buying shoes for their children, about regaining a sense of 
dignity that comes from doing a day's work and supporting their 
families and drawing a paycheck.
	     
	     They're asking those of us who have the privilege of 
serving to put aside politics and do something now to move our 
economy forward.  I am prepared to do that.  And I have been working 
with the Senate to come up with an adjusted package that meets some 
of the concerns of those who have been blocking action on the jobs 
plan.  I'm willing to compromise, so long as we keep the focus on 
jobs, keep the focus on growth and keep the focus on meeting unmet 
national needs.  
	     
	     Our opponents have been asking for a smaller package.  
Today I ask them to join me in determining exactly what kind and what 
size package Congress can approve that actually meets the needs of 
the American people. 
	     
	     But even as we make those reductions and the package 
will be smaller, I believe we must address problems that are on the 
minds of millions of Americans, and one in particular, and that is 
the need to toughen law enforcement in our society to deal with the 
dramatic rise in violent crime. 
	     
	     So I will ask, even in this reduced package, for an 
additional $200 million in federal funding to help local communities 
to rehire police officers who have been laid off because of the 
fiscal problems caused by the national recession.  Together, with a 
matching effort by local governments, this could put as many as 
10,000 police officers back on the job, and back on the beat in 
communities all across our nation.
	     
	     At a time when too many of our people live in fear of 
violent crime, when too many businesses have closed and too many 
people have lost their jobs because people are afraid to leave their 
homes, rehiring thousands of officers is one of the best investments 
America can make.  And I ask both Houses of Congress to make that 
investment in our people's safety and in their piece of mind.  
	     
	     I believe in the need for strong federal action to keep 
the economy going toward recovery and to create jobs.  Make no 
mistake about it:  I will fight for these priorities as hard as I 
ever have.  I will never forget that the people sent me here to fight 
for their jobs, their future and for fundamental change.
	     
	     I want to thank the police officers who are here today 
and tell you that not a single one of them knew before they came here 
that I had determined to ask for more money in this jobs bill to 
rehire police officers.  They came here because they believe in the 
summer jobs portion of the package.  And I want them to be free to 
talk about that.  They came here not out of any law enforcement 
concern other than the fact that they wanted the kids in this country 
to have a chance to have jobs this summer, to have safer streets and 
a brighter and more peaceful future.
	     
	     I say what I say today not just because it's good for 
law enforcement but because it's good for the people who live in 
these communities.  I have always supported community policing not 
only because it helps to prevent crime and to lower the crime rate, 
but because it cements better relationships between people in law 
enforcement and the people that they're hired to protect.  It reduces 
the chances of abusive action by police officers and increases the 
chances of harmony and safe streets at the same time.
	     
	     These are the kinds of things that we are trying to do.  
I promised in my campaign that I'd do everything I could to put 
another 100,000 police officers on the street over the next four 
years.  This makes a good downpayment on that.  This keeps in mind 
the core of the jobs package.  And this will help us to move forward.  
	     
	     So I ask the people in the Senate who have blocked the 
jobs bill, let's work together.  I can accept a reduced package if 
you will increase your commitment to safe streets.  I do not accept 
the fact that we should reduce our commitment to summer jobs or to 
building our infrastructure or to doing those other things that will 
create real and lasting  prosperity for our people.  I have done my 
part now to end the gridlock; I ask you to do yours.  
	     
	     I want now to give the people who are here with me on 
the platform a chance to make some remarks and to be heard by the 
American people -- beginning with Janet Reno, the distinguished 
Attorney General.
  
	     
	     *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   * 
	     
	     Q	  Mr. President, can you tell us -- do you think that 
the jobs package could be put in further jeopardy by controversy over 
the suggestion of a VAT tax at this point in the congressional 
dialogue?
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  Not at all.  I think it should have --
they wouldn't have any relationship one to the other.  First of all, 
I made absolutely no decision on that.  You should know that there's 
a lot of support in the business community and the labor community -- 
people have asked us to consider that because of the enormous burden 
of the present system on many of our major employers, particularly 
many of those that we depend upon to generate jobs and to carry the 
strength of this economy.  But I have made absolutely no decision 
that would even approach that on that or any other kind of general 
tax.
	     
	     Q	  Do you personally believe that the American public 
is ready to pay for -- to have another tax to pay for health care?  I 
mean, apart from what business and labor leaders have said --
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  I'm not going to speculate on that.  I 
will say this:  The real issue is how quickly we can recycle the 
benefits of all the savings to cover the cost.  I mean, that is --
everyone knows that if you do what we're proposing to do, if you 
streamline the insurance system, if you fix the system so that 
there's no longer an enormous economic incentive to over-utilize or 
over-provide certain services, if you provide primary and preventive 
care in places where it isn't now, every single analysis shows 
absolutely massive savings to the health care system.
	     
	     The real question is whether you can transfer those 
savings to cover those who have no coverage now or those who have 
virtually no coverage so that you provide people the security.  I 
have no idea.  The polls say that, but I don't know.  All I know is 
the polls that I see in the press that many of you have commissioned, 
they say overwhelmingly the American people want the security of an 
affordable health care system.
	     
	     But I don't think that has anything to do with this 
stimulus, and it certainly shouldn't have.  People want a job first 
and foremost.  They want that more than anything else.
	     
	     Q	  Now that you've announced your willingness to 
compromise on the stimulus package, can you tell us what parts of 
your package you consider vital and uncompromisable?  I assume summer 
jobs is one.
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  I want the summer jobs; I want the 
highway program and I want the police program.  I still intend -- let 
me say this:  I still intend to fully and aggressively push the crime 
bill, which did not pass the Congress last year.  This is a 
supplement to that, not a substitute for it in any way.  But I think 
we need to do that.
	     
	     I think we need the Ryan White funds because of the 
enormous health care burdens to the communities that are inordinately 
and disproportionately affected by the problems of caring for people 
with AIDS.  And there are several other things that I think should be 
done.  We have to do the Agriculture Department meat inspectors; the 
safety of the public depends on that.  
	     
	     There are a number of other things that I don't -- I 
don't think any of it should be cut, but I have given Senator 
Mitchell and Senator Byrd -- I talked to them.  And Senator Dole 
called me yesterday to discuss this, and I told him that I would call 
him back.  I called him back last night in New Hampshire and we 
discussed this.  And I basically asked them to talk today, and said 
that I would not make any statements about any specifics until at 
least they had a chance to talk to see whether or not they could 
reach some accord.  
	     
	     So I don't want to be any more specific than I have been 
already, and let's see if they can talk it out.
	     
	     Q	  When you talked to Senator Dole and Senator 
Mitchell did you tell them about your -- increase also, that $200 
million, that you want that as part of the package?
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  I did -- I told Senator -- I left word 
for Senator Mitchell last night about it.  When I talked to Senator 
Dole -- I don't remember for sure -- I do not believe I mentioned it.  
But I did tell him that I was prepared to reduce the package and I 
wanted to break the gridlock, and I told him that I was working on a 
reformulation of it so that -- in the hope that it would become even 
more focused on jobs and the kinds of issues that I thought the 
American people wanted us to address.  And this is certainly 
consistent with that.
	     
	     Thank you.

Yes, it was specifically the *ability* or understanding of the
technique which was absent.  We have made a lot of progress between
rider education and responsibility over the last ten-twenty years...
but I am still amazed anytime I teach an ERC how many people of many
year riding experience "discover" countersteering for cornering or
swerving.

The specific recommandation cited in the Hurt study was that a formal
"street strategy", like SIPDE for example, was the most important
component of any rider education curriculum.  The specific skills of
emergency braking, cornering and swerving must be taught and practiced
as well, but more significant was that 35% of rider did NOTHING
confronted with a potential accident, and another third collided or
fell over as a result of rider error.  The choice of specific maneuver
is much less significant to the outcome than early detection and
the proper execution of ANY effective countermeasure.

Hmm... now where was that ad for the combination radio/hand cranked

Sure, you've already got the right idea.

Ignoring the 50 ohm internal resistance of the generator for a second, just
run it into, say, a voltage divider made of 990 ohms in series with 10
ohms.  This new circuit is the Thevenin equivalent of one that puts out
1/100 of the original voltage, and has an output impedence of negligibly
less than 10 ohms.  You may want to monkey with the values a little
depending on whether you care more about the _exact_ dividing ratio or
the availability of parts.

Hows that sound?

					---Joel Kolstad

P.S. -- This is why those 1000:1 high voltage probes for multimeters can be
accurate but still cheap.  They have something like 100 megs in series with
100k, which doesn't load the (often high impedence) source much, as well as
keeping the (probably 10 meg impedance) multimeter happy.


This morning a truck that had been within my sight (and I within
his) for about 3 miles suddenly forgot that I existed and pulled
over right on me -- my front wheel was about even with the back
edge of his front passenger door as I was accelerating past him.

It was trivial enough for me to tap the brakes and slide behind him
as he slewed over (with no signal, of course) on top of me, with
my little horn blaring (damn, I need Fiamms!), but the satisfaction
of being aware of my surroundings and thus surviving was not enough,
especially when I later pulled up alongside the bastard and he made
no apologetic wave or anything.

Is there some way that I can memorize the license plate of an
offending vehicle and get the name and address of the owner?
I'm not going to firebomb houses or anything, I'd just like to
write a consciousness-raising letter or two. I think that it would
be good for BDI cagers to know that We Know Where They Live.
Maybe they'd use 4 or 5 brain cells while driving instead of the
usual 3.

Joe,

     As usual, this issue of dysfunction, of bad values, of messed up culture 
is easily embraced by non african americans when it comes to explaining
problems in our community. From your post, you apparently find the idea that
something is wrong with African Americans, value-wise, culture wise or
something, very appealing. I never cease to be amazed at how eager non african
americans are to embrace theories about our problems which basically assert
that something is wrong with us. The socio-economic factors which we know help 
to produce high crime levels, like poverty, which exists among us in large 
proportion, I mean when it comes to discussion of african american problems, we
somehow become exempt from all these types of factors, and the problem is 
laid at the doorstep of some neboulous dysfunction we supposedly have. But 
nobody attributes crime amongst white americans to dysfunction. No, that has 
socioeconomic factors to it, but for africa americans, its gotta be a 
dysfunction.

Basically, I think this tendency for non african americans to believe that
something is wrong with us exists because non african americans don't want to
deal with the possiblility that the society is deeply biased against african
americans, and that this is about 80% of the problem. It could not possible be
that the society is so deeply racist and structured against us, that this has
a very effective negative effect on us. No, something is wrong with us.
Non african americans are quick to disregard what we have to say, because they 
are so busy trying to find something wrong with us, instead of taking a good 
hard look at the thing we say are doing us damage. I would get angry if it 
werent' so damn typical.

Peace - Aaron

I don't want to get into a semantic argument, but contrary to some other
postings "near UV light" /is/ "actual UV light."  The "near" means that
it is close to the visible spectrum (i.e. of relatively long wavelength),
not that it is "nearly UV."  (I'm sure you can figure out now just what
"far UV" is.)

Regular incandenscent flashlight bulbs emit tiny amounts of UV in the
near end of the spectrum, such that a filter can be used to remove the
visible light and thus create a weak UV source.  Stronger sources are
going to require gas (probably mercury vapor) discharge tubes (such as
fluorescent tubes with UV phosphor).  Be careful, though; strong UV
sources can cause physiological damage, especially to the eyes.  The
shorter wavelengths are the most dangerous.

It wouldn't project a beam like a flashlight, but replacing the tubes
in a portable fluorescent lantern with UV tubes would be a relatively
cheap way to create a portable source.  It would be bright enough to
be useful, but not dangerously so.

   I've been following discussions about the Delta Clipper program, and I
have one small question.  As I understand it, the DC-X derived orbital
vehicle (DC-Y & 1) is to reenter the atmosphere sort of sideways, not
completely nose-first.  So why is the DC-Y look symmetric in every drawing
I've seen?  I would think that an asymmetric design, sort of like

The observation that the Tree of Life would rotate clockwise in the
northern hemisphere and counterclockwise in the southern probably doesn't
give enough consideration to the feebleness of the Coriolis force compared
to, say, the phototropism of vegetation.  A much more likely explanation
is the classic one: that the clockwise swastika is the Sun-wheel, because
the sun progresses across the sky that way.  (Although that's not the
historical way it happened; clocks were first made as little imitation
images of the sun moving thru the heavens.  So it's more valid to talk of
the clock going sunwise, but do the engineers listen to me?  Of course
not.)  Anyway, there is still much uncertainty about whether the
anti-swastika goes counter-sunwise because that represents Evil, or
because it is the Sun's twin-opposite, the Moonwheel.  The use of anti-Sun
to represent Evil may be because humans are so strongly visually-oriented,
but I'm not going to try to settle THAT one just now.

Imprecise. This description

 1. ignores the role of the ballast,
 2. misrepresents the heating effects in the starter.

The bimetalic strip cools down immediately after the contacts
short circuit, because the neon discharge stops, and much less
heat is generated from the I^2R loss in the metal as compared to
the neon discharge.

The starter contacts open before the tube fires.  Actually,
the tube fires as a result of the back-emf generated in the ballast
because of this immediate opening of the starter's contacts.

A capacitor is connected in parallel with the contacts to prevent
excessive arcing during the firing.  The neon reionizes but does not draw
sufficient current to prevent firing of the tube itself.

No.  There are two problems here:

(1) Peter died two millenia ago.  The original letters he wrote have
long since decayed into dust.  If he were alive today and I could
question him, then this might lend credibility to your claims (but
probably not much, because after all, I've heard people claim with all
sincerity that they've spoken with Elvis recently).  But after his
death, Peter's writings were transcribed by monks for centuries, and I
find it hard to believe that one of them somewhere didn't decide to
change the wording of something to make it (in his opinion) a little
easier to understand.

(2) Even if Peter did witness the miracles of Jesus two millenia ago,
that doesn't mean that your deity is what the Bible says it is (God
might just be Satan, trying to convince everyone that he's a nice
guy), or even that your deity is still alive and active in the world
today.

Nice try, but it just isn't enough to convince me, especially since
your wild claims about your deity seem to fly in the face of the way
I've observed the world to work.  Please find something more compelling.

And does it not say in scripture that no man knows the hour of His coming, not
even the angels in Heaven but only the Father Himself?  DK was trying to play
God by breaking the seals himself.  DK killed himself and as many of his
followers as he could.  BTW, God did save the children.  They are in Heaven,
a far better place.  How do I know?  By faith.

I would like to add my support for a misc.taoism discussion group.
I applaud the enthusiam shown by the person posting <79899@cup.portal.com>

with him/her in believing that at least some minimal parameters 
should be agreed upon.

But if we don't limit it to *something*, the discussion degenerates into
a big amorphous glob. 

Other questions Thyagi proposes are:

> 1) What is this 'actual process of reality'?
> 2) Why is Taoism based upon an assumption?
> 3) Why does this assumption concern knowledge and what can be known?
> 4) What is the value of not knowing?
> 5) What is 'a Tao'?  What does it mean to be 'Tao'd'?

It seems to me that these questions more properly fall into the
category of "general metaphysics". I would prefer any misc.taoism
to deal more closely with topics and works more closely associated
with at least "semi-orthodox" Taoism: with established classic works 
definitely included and works like Mantak Chia's argued about! 

I think "neo-Taoism" should be excluded or get its own group (what I
mean by this is "Humpty-Dumpty Taoism", in which Taoism means whatever 
a poster says it means.) This "alt.taoism" could also be a refuge 
for debates about what "Taoism *REALLY* means" or speculations on sexual
alchemy, etc..

e.g. (from Thyagi again):
> Taoism does what the hell it wants, I tell you.
> Taoism doesn't exist.  'Taoism' is no more real that 'Tao'.  Decide, now.
> Real or not real?  Exist or not-exist?  When shall we be certain

Kent gloomily predicts (quoting from Thyagi's article):

> However most traffic in 
> the group will likely concern the philosophical, secular taoism
> averred by Alan Watts and Niels Bohr, and yogic taoism as it pertains
> to medical, sexual and martial techniques.

I think that discussions of this nature are not completely out of
place. What's happening is that that the term "Taoism" is becoming
completely polluted and trivialized like the words "magic", "Alchemy", 
"Zen," etc., by writers appropriating the word to mean whatever they 
want. This is seen by the spate of new age books entitled "The
Tao of" this, that, and everything else. (With respect to some exceptions
like the books by Jou, Tsung-Hwa.)

Any other comments/ideas? I look forward to seeing them. On balance,
I say let misc.taoism rip and let the chips fall where they may. If
it just gets filled up with college freshmen asking about the
Tao of Sex then it will have been a failure and people will post to
these groups just as they do now.

Any comments on the absorbtion of the Office of Exploration into the
Office of Space Sciences and the reassignment of Griffin to the "Chief
Engineer" position?  Is this just a meaningless administrative
shuffle, or does this bode ill for SEI?

In my opinion, this seems like a Bad Thing, at least on the surface.
Griffin seemed to be someone who was actually interested in getting
things done, and who was willing to look an innovative approaches to
getting things done faster, better, and cheaper.  It's unclear to me
whether he will be able to do this at his new position.

Does anyone know what his new duties will be?

Thanks for the information!

I assume p is the semi-major axis and e the eccentricity.  The peri-
helion and aphelion are then given by p(1-e) and p(1+e), i.e., about
2.90 and 3.95 AU respectively.  For Jupiter, they are 4.95 and 5.45 AU.
If 1977 was after the temporary capture, this means that the comet
ended up in an orbit that comes no closer than 1 AU to Jupiter's --
which I take to be a rough indication of how far from Jupiter it could
get under Jupiter's influence.

> Also, perihelions of Gehrels3 were:

Where 1 Jupiter radius = 71,000 km = 44,000 mi = 0.0005 AU.  So the
1970 figure seems unlikely to actually be anything but a perijove.
Is that the case for the 1973 figure as well?

Yes!  Up the coast, over to Portland, then up I-5.  Really nice most

I own the Adcom 60W power amp.  As far as I'm concerned, there's no
  amp which can touch it at the price range.
The build quality is very impressive and is far superior to other 
  amps in the price range.  The whole amplifier is extremely solid
  with massive heat sinks and very solid casing.
If you open the amp up, there are only very good quality components 
  in and the amp seems to be designed extremely well.  Perfect
  symmetry for both channels and TWO transformers - one for each
  channel.  The binding posts on the back of the amplifier are
  virtually the same as those on the Classe model 70 ie. very good.

I was also sceptical about the amps being built in the far-east
  or where-ever.  But if you look in the amp and see what components
  they use and how it was designed, you can easily see why the
  amplifiers sound so brilliant.
I cannot see why people say the amplifier won't last - not with
  those quality components inside.  Sure the amp runs very fairly
  hot - but that's how you get an amp to sound incredibly good.

My last point, I recently auditioned the Adcom preamp something like
  the 545 or something.  It was two years old and it still sounded
  like new.

If you build an amplifier decently, like the Adcom's, they will
  sound brilliant and last a long time - period.

Just my thoughts, but then - I do own one of Adcom's amps.

Bill, you are kidding yourself here. Firstly, motorcycles do not steer
themselves - only the rider can do that. Secondly, it is the adhesion of the
tyre on the road, the suspension geometry  and the ground clearance of the
 motorcycle which dictate how quickly you can swerve to avoid obstacles, and
not the knowledge of physics between the rider's ears. Are you seriously
suggesting that countersteering knowledge enables you to corner faster
or more competentlY than you could manage otherwise??

Formal training in this country (as far as I am aware) does not include
countersteering theory.  I found out about countersteering about six years ago,
from a physics lecturer who was also a motorcyclist. I didn't believe him
at first when he said I steered my bike to the right to make it turn left,
but I went out and analysed closely what I was doing, and realized he was 
right! It's an interesting bit of knowledge, and I've had a lot of fun since
then telling others about it, who were at first as sceptical as I was. But
that's all it is - an interesting bit of knowledge, and to claim that
it is essential for all bikers to know it, or that you can corner faster
or better as a result, is absurd.

Formal training is in my view absolutely essential if you're going to
be able to ride a bike properly and safely. But by including countersteering
theory in newbie courses we are confusing people unnecessarily, right at
the time when there are *far* more important matters for them to learn.
And that was my original point.

Mike

The NACA came up with them before World War II.  NASA is directly
descended from the NACA, with space added in.

You'll notice that I didn't mention sweep wings even though the
X-5, tested at what's now Dryden, had them.  We did steal that one
dirctly from the Germans.  The difference is that swept wings don't
change their angle of sweep, sweep wings do.  Perhaps the similarity
of names has caused some confusion?  747s have swept wings, F-111s
have sweep wings.

>Winglets.  Area ruling.  Digital fly by wire.  Ride smoothing.

Phil> A lot of this was also done by the military...

After NASA aerodynamicists proposed them and NASA test teams
demonstrated them.  Richard Whitcomb and R.T. Jones, at Langley
Research Center, were giants in the field.

Dryden was involved in the flight testing of winglets and area
ruling (in the 70s and 50s, respectively).  It's true that we
used military aircraft as the testbeds (KC-135 and YF-102) but
that had more to do with availability and need than with military
involvement.  The YF-102 was completely ours and the KC-135 was
bailed to us.  The Air Force, of course, was interested in our
results and supportive of our efforts.

Dryden flew the first digital fly by wire aircraft in the 70s. No
mechnaical or analog backup, to show you how confident we were.
General Dynamics decided to make the F-16 flyby-wire when they saw how
successful we were.  (Mind you, the Avro Arrow and the X-15 were both
fly-by-wire aircraft much earlier, but analog.)

Phil> Egad! I'm disagreeing with Mary Shafer!  

The NASA habit of acquiring second-hand military aircraft and using
them for testbeds can make things kind of confusing.  On the other
hand, all those second-hand Navy planes give our test pilots a chance
to fold the wings--something most pilots at Edwards Air Force Base
can't do.

Hell, yes. I'm not going to let a bunch of seven suits tell

to leave their scheme stable for a fiscal year or two.


Seriously though. If you were to ask the British government

This might a real wierd idea or maybe not..

that then drys and makes hard walls...

Why not do the same thing for a space station..

Fly up the docking rings and baloon materials and such, blow up the baloons,
spin then around (I know a problem in micro gravity) let them dry/cure/harden?
and cut a hole for the docking/attaching ring and bingo a space station..

Of course the ballons would have to be foil covered or someother radiation
protective covering/heat shield(?) and the material used to make the wals would
have to meet the out gasing and other specs or atleast the paint/covering of
the inner wall would have to be human safe.. Maybe a special congrete or maybe
the same material as makes caplets but with some changes (saw where someone
instea dof water put beer in the caplet mixture, got a mix that was just as
strong as congret but easier to carry around and such..)

Sorry for any spelling errors, I missed school today.. (grin)..

Why musta  space station be so difficult?? why must we have girders? why be
confined to earth based ideas, lets think new ideas, after all space is not
earth, why be limited by earth based ideas??

I was not discussing "universal" definitions in this post, Mark. Please

Do you agree with my statement above about physicians being unqualified if
they can't determine viability?

And that's good enough for the law, Mark. So why do you keep whining that
viability "isn't defined"? What purpose does your whining serve?

I totally agree.  Really, the only people this is going to benefit, are
those who live in the cities where the train stops.  Who wants to drive
to the train station from X (Lubbock for example)?  It's probably farther
to drive to the train station than it is to the nearest national airport.

I really can't see spending 5.7 billion on a system that only three cities
will benefit from.

Good question.  I don't have a nice concise answer, though.  What about the
child whose parents are crushed emotionally because he/she starts a carerr
doing something they greatly dislike.  It is the same kind of harm, and
is probably "caused" by the same thing:  The desire of the child to be

	There are actually a few important things we can glean from this mess:
1)	When they start getting desperate for an answer to the question: "What's
it all about. Mr. Natural?", pinkboys will buy darn near *anything*, which
means:
2)	There's still plenty of $$$$ to be made in the False Jesus business
by enterprising SubGenii.  Just remember that:
3)	Once you've separated the pinks from their green, don't blow it all
on automatic weapons from Mexico.  Put it in a Swiss bank account.  Smile a
lot.  Have your flunkies hand out flowers in airports.  The Con will just
shrug you off as long as:
4)	You never, never, NEVER start to believe your own bulldada!  If
"David Koresh" hand't started swallowing his own "apocalypso now" crap, he'd
be working crossword puzzles in the Bahamas today instead of contributing to
the mulch layer in Waco.  This is because:
5)	When you start shooting at cops, they're likely to shoot back.  And 
most of 'em are better shots than you are.

	In short:
	- P.T. Barnum was right 
		and
	- Stupidity is self-correcting
Thus endeth the lesson.

	I have a new scope and I thought I'd save a few bucks by
buying one with a function generator built in. After having it awhile
I noticed two things about the function generator. For one, there
seems to be a bias even when the 'pull-offset' is pushed in. That is,
I have to pull that know and adjust it to get a signal sans some
random 50mV bias.
	The other _really_ annoying thing is that the damn output
won't go below about 1V p-p. I am a student ( you may have guessed
from my previous posts ), and I often have to measure the input
impedances of various circuits I build.Many of the circuits have
maximum input signals of way less than 500mV amplitude and most have
input impedances in the 10's of Kohm range. The thing is, in order to
use my function generator I have to divide the voltage to some thing
reasonable. Then, of course, to measurethe input impedance of my
circuit I am going to have to throw in another resistor in series.
With the 50ohm output of the generator I could just ignore it, but now
with this little divider there I have to figure that in. It's kind of
a pain in  the ass.
	Is there any way I could make myself a little box that could
solve this little problem. The box would tkae the function generator
input, lower the voltage and give an output impedance that is some
low, unchanging number. I would want to lower the voltage by a factor
of one hundred or so. I could just build a little buffer amp, but I'd
like to have this box not be active.
	Any quick ideas. The scope's not broken. For other reasons I
had sent it to the shop to get repaired and they replaced it. The
function generator was the same way on that one, too.

OK, I've asked this before, and with a new thread on these lines, I
ask this again:

1: If a large hole current is run thru a resistor, will there be
   I^2 * R cooling instead of heating?

2: Can anyone design an amplifier that preferentially amplifies
   hole currents over normal electron currents?

3: what semiconductor materials have the highest ratio of
   hole mobility to electron mobility? (please quote actual
   test samples rather than estimates based on theory. Also,
   don't be limited to semiconductors: consider also insulators,
   resistors, dielectrics, piezo-electrics, conductors,
   magnets (metal, ceramic), magnetostrictives, etc).

NOTES:

   to summarize, this thread has so far stated that the only area
   where holes are not detectable is the vacuum. That is, hole
   particles only exist in the presence of matter.
   Previous threads have stated that holes only exist in certain
   semi-conductors. The question that naturally arises is if
   the hole currents inside a semi-conductor vanish at the point
   where the semiconductor is joined to a conductor (say, copper).
   I don't want a theoretical discussion here about whether
   holes could exist inside metal conductors, rather I ask for
   an experimental discussion on how to amplify and detect such
   currents *if* they exist.
   Also note that I have cross-posted this to sci.electronics
   since this is now becoming an electronic discussion.

Thanx,
Eric.

  A Alan Brock 4/14/93 Orange County Register Editorial titled "A case for
  repealing the income tax" got my attention.

  Some quotes:

   "... a tax on income, because of the flexible definition of that
   concept, invites the government to snoop into every nook and
   cranny of our lives. Encouraging people to snoop on one another
   and report transgressions against the almighty state, which most
   Americans deplored in Nazi or communist regimes..." 

   "... Although most Americans paid no income tax at all 50 years ago
   -- withholding began only during World War II, as a "temporary"
   exigency, and in 1948 the median family federal income tax was $9..."

   "Last year the federal government got only 37 percent of its income
    from income taxes... How long ago was it that the federal government
    somehow managed to stagger along on 63 percent of its 1992 revenue?
    ... Would you believe five?..."

   "... The income tax has converted a free people into a society of
    the fearful and the snitches..."





Okay, lets get the record straight on the Livermore gas gun.  
The project manager is Dr. John Hunter, and he works for the
Laser group at Livermore.  What, you may ask, does gas guns
have to do with lasers? Nothing, really, but the gun is physically
located across the road from the Free Electron Laser building,
and the FEL building has a heavily shielded control room (thick walls)
from which the gun firings are controlled.  So I suspect that the
office he works for is an administrative convenience.

I visited Hunter at the beginning of Feb. and we toured the gun.
At the time I was working on gas gun R&D at Boeing, where I work,
but I am now doing other things (helping to save the space station),

The gun uses a methane-air mixture, which is burned in a chamber
about 200 ft long by 16 inch ID (i.e. it looks like a pipe).
The chamber holds a 1 ton piston which is propelled at several
hundred m/s down the chamber.  On the other side of the piston
is hudrogen gas, initially at room temperature andsome tens
of atmospheres.

The piston compresses and heats the hydrogen ahead of it until
a stainless steel burst diaphragm ruptures, at around 50,000 psi.
The barrel of the gun is about 100 feet long and has a 4 inch
bore.  It is mounted at right angles to the chamber (i.e. they
intersect).  This was done so that in the future, the barrel
could be raised and the gun fired into the air without having to
move the larger and heavier chamber.  The projectile being used
in testing is a 5 kg cylinder of Lexan plastic, 4 in in diameter
and about 50 cm long.

All of the acceleration comes from the expansion of the hydrogen
gas from 50,000 psi downwards until the projectile leaves the
barrel.  The barrel is evacuated, and the end is sealed with a
sheet of plastic film (a little thicker than Saran wrap).  The
plastic is blown off by the small amount of residual air trapped
in the barrel ahead of the projectile.  

The gun is fired into a bunker filled with sandbags and plastic
water jugs.  In the early testing fragments of the plastic
projectile were found.  At the higher speeds in later testing,
the projectile vaporizes.

The testing is into a bunker because the Livermore test range is
about 3 miles across, and the projectile would go 100-200 km
if fired for maximum range.  The intent is to move the whole gun
to Vandenberg AFB after the testing is complete, where they can
fire into the Pacific Ocean, and use the tracking radar at VAFB
to follow the projectiles.

The design goal of the gun is to throw a 5 kg projectile at 4
km/s (half of orbital speed).  So far they have reached 2 km/s,
and the gun is currently down for repairs, as on the last test
they blew a seal and damaged some of the hardware (I think it
had to do with the methane-air more detonating than burning, but
I haven't had a chance to talk to Hunter directly on this).

There are people waiting to test scramjet components in this
gun by firing then out of the gun into the air (at Mach 12=
4 km/s), since the most you can get in wind tunnels is Mach 8.

This gun cost about 4 million to develop, and is basically
a proof-of-concept for a bigger gun capable of firing useful-
sized payloads into space.  This would require on the order of
100 kg projectiles, which deliver on the order of 20 kg
useful payload to orbit.

I missed the presentations given in the morning session (when Shea gave
his "rambling and almost inaudible" presentation), but I did attend
the afternoon session. The meeting was in a small conference room. The
speaker was wired with a mike, and there were microphones on the table for
the panel members to use. Peons (like me) sat in a foyer outside the
conference room, and watched the presentations on closed circuit TV. In
general, the sound system was fair to poor, and some of the other
speakers (like the committee member from the Italian Space Agency)
also were "almost inaudible."

Shea didn't "lead the formal presentation," in the sense of running
or guiding the presentation. He didn't even attend the afternoon
session. Vest ran the show (President of MIT, the chair of the

The fact that she was wearing a miniskirt with no underwear was

Here's a rough sketch of how the system works.  A reference station
with a very exactly known position computes the errors in the
incoming GPS signals.  These errors are due to several factors
including atmospheric distortion, SA (Selective Availability) time
dithering, etc.  The reference unit contains complex computational 
equipment to "back out" the errors in its position (since it knows
where it is already).  It then transmits these corrections on a 
broadcast which is available to any number of relatively local
receivers.  If the receivers are nearby (<300km) and are using
the same satellites as the reference unit, the errors should be very
similar for the reference unit and the receiver unit.  Thus, the
receiver unit may apply the corrections calculated by the reference
unit.

The US Coast Guard is currently (as far as I know) installing a series
of coastline transmitters for differential GPS.  These stations will
use existing radio towers.  I believe the frequency is to be approximately
305 kHz.  There are many other private corporations offering DGPS signals
on different frequencies.  For example, PinPoint ((310)-618-7076) offers

The Fujitsu 2322 uses what is known as an 'SMD' interface (Storage Module
Device?).  A lot of older minis used it.  Sun still does on their server
models.  There are several different speeds of SMD, and I think that the 
Fuji drive you have is rated at about 24 Mb/sec (thats megabits).  There
used to be several companies that made couplers for the PC (Interphase in
Texas being one), but I think that the market pretty much has dried up.
Controllers for this type of drive are readily available for VME buses
though.  Rumor has it that there is a SMD to SCSI adapter available, but
I think that it was designed for slower SMD devices.  In other words,
if you have a PC or Mac, that drive is pretty much dogmeat.
Cheers,

DEC did this on their new alpha chip.  I'm sure you could call them up

Actually, there are some details in their article in IEEE Journal of

This is cute, but I see no statement telling me why your church is the true 
church. I do presume that you know or at least believe that yours is true. 
Attempting to ream my faith without replacing it with something "better" is 
a real good way to loose a person completely from Christ.

This is the greatest reason I see that these attacks are not motivated by 
love. They only seek to destroy there is no building or replacing of belief. 
This is not something Christ did. He guided and instructed He didn't 
seek to destroy the faith He found, He redirected it. 

This is what I see when people say they "love" <insert favorite group here>. 
And I have to laugh at the irony. 

Please excuse the scarcasm but it was nice to say it. 
Oh, BTW Robert don't take this personally, your post was merely convinent.

The rule for the designations is that if it says MC, that means it works
*exactly* the way the datasheet/book specifies.  If it says XC, that means
there is at least one known bug.  Often these bugs are small and obscure;
you might never run into them in practice.

What's the problem here?  Back in 1958 I rode a Puch 175 from Paris to

of the size of bikes on the road.  A 350 was considered a big bike, and the

If we had backed him strongly early on I doubt there would be the
problem there is now.  Many Russians became disillusioned with democracy
and reforms when they felt, rightly IMO, that the West didn't care.

Yeltsin was virtually promised massive aid (once Bush got over his
Gorby-mania.)  This probably kept him from dismantling the congress
and calling for new elections.  Well, the aid didn't come through
and we didn't make sure it went to the proper places and now the
anti-reformers are gaining strength where before they were in

If they don't reform I don't believe in giving them money.  However,

Despite the wishes of Libertarians, this society is a far way, and getting
farther, from being Libertarian.  Perhaps voluntary gifts would work if
we had the proper framework but we do not have it.  We have to face the
problem *now*, not in X years when we have a Libertarian dream society.

Right now there are huge stumbling blocks to trade, let alone charity.
There are still limitations to high-tech exports.  NASA can't buy
Proton launch vehicles from them.  Sure, the market may be able to
help a great deal but it can't right now.  There are too many obstacles.
Instead of fighting against the aid you should be fighting to 
tear down the obstacles the market and charities have to face.

Well, I think limited government is primarily democratic due
to it being limited.  But the main question is how do you transform
a state-run economy and monolithic government into something that
even remotely looks like ours?  (BTW, sometimes it seems that our government 
is trying to go the opposite direction)  It is not going to be
painless and not going to be easy.  We simply cannot wait to
help when they *have* the 'proper' government.  They'll never
get there without the aid.  It may be too late already.

As I also said above, another problem I have is with *transformation*.
A Libertarian society is not going to happen painlessly or overnight.
I have seen nothing about how to take our current government and
society and turn it into a minimal government and a responsible
self-sufficient populace.

Yes, depend on the rulers of the free market and the businesses.  Rulers
do emerge *somewhere* and they will never represent the opinions of
every person on the planet.  

There must be checks and balances.  Checks on the government when
it gets out of bounds and checks on industry when it gets out of
bounds.  Putting all your hopes on the benevolence of the market
is, to me, just like putting all your hopes on the benevolence of
government.

nothing good to say about them... it appears they are waaaay underpowered,
(basically, it's the 750/900 with a 400cc engine), and there have been some
quality problems (rusty _frame_ !!).  Save your pennies... buy the 900 :)

Of course, 2+1+8+9+7+3+9+3+3+6 = 51, which, quite obviously is 23+23+5...

  I sure hope you got the cost of a replacement panel out of the owner. Here if
the owner should seem reluctant, a stop by the local SPCA (preferably with your
foot/leg all swollen up) to file a viscious dog report would do the trick.

No need to be depressed about this one.  Lights aren't on during the day
so there shouldn't be any daytime light pollution.

Paul,

Unfortunately, there are not too many retail outlets that'll stock
just about every chip made.  The stuff they will stock are the ones
that'll sell, like standard DRAM's, 80386's, 68000's, etc,etc.
i.e.  I cna't think of any 'one-stop-shopping' store.

The closest you can get is to pick up a copy of Byte magazine or
the Circuit Cellar, Popular Electronics, and the like and flip
through them.

Distributors like Wyle Electronics, Hamilton Avnet, Pioneer Electronics,
etc, etc, don't normally deal with end-users like ourselves where
we only a couple of everything...they only deal with people who buy
by the hundreds or more.  Each distributor represents and sells a variety of
different non-competing manufacturers.  What do I mean by this?
Suppose ABC Electronics sells Intel 80386's.  It's a pretty good
bet that they won't be selling any of AMD's 386's, or vice-versa.
They also can obtain just about *any* chip you want from a manufacturer
they represent.

Who knows?  You might be lucky to be able to buy from one of them.
But I'd be suprised if you do.  ALso bear in mind that the 1 or 2
qty prices they will charge you will be *much* greater than what
a mail order outlet will charge.

My advice?  If you're gonna be designing anything, try to stick
with off-the-shelf stuff.  You're going to get stuck if you use
too many esoteric parts sooner or later.

good luck,

aaron

Up to 60 microamperes  =   on hook

Over something like 10 mA  = off hook

In between = defective line, and the phone company comes looking

Heh, heh, heh, heh....I laugh because I have the same damn TV, and it
did the same thing!  Actually it is a Goldstar, but it's essentially the
same TV and electronics--just a different face plate and name.

#1.  Fortunately, TV tubes don't explode.  I'd think the TV mfrs want
to make this possibility remote as possible.  If at all, they'll 
*implode* and the glass that blows out would be the result of the
glass boucing off the back of the tube due to the implosion. In any
case, don't kick it around! :-) 

#2  I fixed the TV after getting a hold of some schematics.  It turned
out to be a blown 2W resistor feeding the flyback transformer.  I guess
the original resistor was a bit too small to dissipate the heat it
created, burning itself out.  I checked to make sure the flyback wasn't
shorted or anything first!  Oh, luckily, I had a resistor handy lying
around that had just the right value for what I needed.  I can't see it
being more than 50 cents!.

Well, needless to say, the TV still works today.  So go get a set of
schematics and have some fun...just don't get shocked poking around
the flyback.

If a six year old child does a funny trick and you say well done he will
do it again and it may be funny. Then they may repeat it over and over
again bu you still have to pretend its funny even though it isn't any
more. Once they are older than six you expect them to realise that doing
the same thing over and over again isn't funny any more.

Basicaly Ed fails to be amusing because he is merely crass. He does not
make jokes that have any political content beyond attempting to ridicule
their target. Calling someone Slick Willie is not funny even if you put
on a red nose while you say it, it was a good debating point used on the
spur of the moment 12 months ago but now its use merely demonstrates that the
user couldn't think of anything original to say.


In the UK there is a tradition of old retired Colnels who bore the dinner
guests rigid with their descriptions of old campagns. Ed is clearly one
of this type of people who fails to see when a joke is spent.

After reading the service manual for my bike (Suzuki GS500E--1990) I have
a couple of questions I hope you can answer:

When checking the oil level with the dip stick built into the oil fill
cap, does one check it with the cap screwed in or not?  I am more used to
the dip stick for a cage where the stick is extracted fully, wiped clean
and reinserted fully, then withdrawn and read.  The dip stick on my bike
is part of the oil filler cap and has about 1/2 inch of threads on it.  Do
I remove the cap, wipe the stick clean and reinsert it with/without
screwing it down before reading?

The service manual calls for the application of Suzuki Bond No. 1207B on
the head cover.  I guess this is some sort of liquid gasket material.  do
you know of a generic (cheaper) substitute?

My headlight is a Halogen 60/55 W bulb.  Is there an easy, brighter
replacement bulb available?  Where should I look for one?

As always, I very much appreciate your help.  The weather in Philadelphia
has finally turned WARM.  This weekend I saw lotsa bikes, and the riders
ALL waved.  A nice change of tone from what Philadelphia can be like. . . .

Chris

   Hi All!

   I would like to know what are the popular ICs of the type, their capabilities
(# of channels et.c.) and prices :-)

   Great thanks,

 Andrew.


   We run "SpaceNews & Views" on our STAREACH BBS, a local
operation running WWIV software with the capability to link to
over 1500 other BBS's in the U.S.A. and Canada through WWIVNet.
   Having just started this a couple of months ago, our sub us
currently subscribed by only about ten other boards, but more
are being added.
   We get our news articles re on Internet, via ftp from NASA
sites, and from a variety of aerospace related periodicals. We
get a fair amount of questions on space topics from students
who access the system.

The European Space Agency has involvement with remote earth 
observation, and I presume this includes surveillance (optical etc.).
So it's not just the US/USSR(ex) who are in the game.

But what *is* the game? What can be done with space observation?
The military functions of missile spotting, troop spotting etc. are well
documented, but what about anything else?

The biggest eg I can think of is to get a  metal sensing sat over a
paying country and scan their territory for  precious metals.

More importantly, if radar can spot water vapour (clouds), presumably
a radar based sat will be capable of spotting rivers,open water and 
*underground water* from space. This would be a positive life saver
for African or other drought affected countries. Implementing a
clean water and irrigation program would be of imense benifit to such
countries and should cut down mortalities considerably.

So how about it? Is there a charity or government agency that would
pay for a third world country to have their minerals and water deposits
mapped?

Or is this still sci-fi?

Mail replies would be great.

Thought for the day: Thermal energy needs water to make steam so sstick
it in the ocean!

(1)  Stephen said you took a quote out of context
(2)  You noted that Stephen had not replied to some other t.r.m article
     (call it A) that took a quote out of context
(3)  But the lack of evidence for X does not constitute evidence for the
     lack of X  (a common creationist error)
(4)  So the fact that Stephen did not reply to A does not justify the
     conclusion that Stephen condoned taking quotes out of context in A
(5)  You asked Stephen to explain why you were wrong and they were OK,
     or to acknowledge that he was being a hypocrite.  
(6)  Both of the choices you give Stephen assume that he condoned
     taking quotes out of context in A.
(7)  I assumed you were being logical, and that the sentence that begins
     "Could you please explain ..." was not a nonsequitur, but was intended
     to follow from the sentence that preceded it.
(8)  Therefore, I concluded that you believed that (2) implied that Stephen
     condoned taking quotes out of context in A
(9)  But we've already seen that (2) does not imply this
(10) Therefore, you were incorrect to believe that (2) implied that Stephen
     thought it was okay to take quotes out of context in A, and were 
     making an error of a kind that is frequently made by creationists.

Is that better Jim?   It's called an argument.  If you disagree with it,
explain why the argument is not sound.  (I admit that my assumption in (7)
may have been a bit hasty.)  If you agree with it, just say "yup."

dj
"Yup." -- Jim's e-mailed response when I pointed out, in a posted article,

                             THE DIVINE MASTERS       
      
               Most Christians would agree, and correctly so, that 
          Jesus Christ was a Divine Master, and a projection of God 
          into the physical world, God Incarnate. 
          
               But there are some very important related facts that 
          Christians are COMPLETELY IGNORANT of, as are followers of 
          most other world religions. 
           
               First, Jesus Christ was NOT unique, John 3:16 NOTWITH-
          STANDING.  There is ALWAYS at least one such Divine Master 
          (God Incarnate) PHYSICALLY ALIVE in this world AT ALL TIMES, 
          a continuous succession THROUGHOUT HISTORY, both before and 
          after the life of Jesus. 
    
               The followers of some of these Masters founded the 
          world's major religions, usually PERVERTING the teachings of 
          their Master in the process.  Christians, for example, added 
          THREATS of "ETERNAL DAMNATION" in Hell, and DELETED the 
          teaching of REincarnation. 
       
               Secondly, and more importantly, after a particular 
          Master physically dies and leaves this world, there is 
          NOTHING that He can do for ANYbody except for the relatively 
          few people that He INITIATED while He was still PHYSICALLY 
          alive.  (THAT IS SIMPLY THE WAY GOD SET THINGS UP IN THE 
          UNIVERSES.)                             

               Therefore, all those Christians who worship Jesus, and 
          pray to Jesus, and expect Jesus to return and save them from 
          their sins, are only KIDDING THEMSELVES, and have allowed 
          themselves to be DUPED by a religion that was mostly 
          MANUFACTURED by the Romans. 
      
               And emotional "feelings" are a TOTALLY DECEIVING 
          indicator for religious validity. 
    
               These things are similarly true for followers of most 
          other major world religions, including Islam. 
     
               Thirdly, the primary function of each Master is to tune 
          His Initiates into the "AUDIBLE LIFE STREAM" or "SOUND 
          CURRENT", (referred to as "THE WORD" in John 1:1-5, and as 
          "The River of Life" in Revelation 22:1), and to personally 
          guide each of them thru the upper levels of Heaven while they 
          are still connected to their living physical bodies by a 
          "silver cord". 
    
               True Salvation, which completes a Soul's cycles of 
          REincarnation in the physical and psychic planes, is achieved 
          only by reaching at least the "SOUL PLANE", which is five 
          levels or universes above the physical universe, and this 
          canNOT be done without the help of a PHYSICALLY-Living Divine 
          Master. 
    
               One such Divine Master alive today is an American, Sri 
          Harold Klemp, the Living "Eck" Master or "Mahanta" for the 
          "Eckankar" organization, now headquartered in Minneapolis, 
          (P.O. Box 27300;  zip 55427). 
    
               Another Divine Master is Maharaj Gurinder Singh Ji, now 
          living in Punjab, India, and is associated with the "Sant 
          Mat" organization. 
      
               One of the classic books on this subject is "THE PATH OF 
          THE MASTERS" (Radha Soami Books, P.O. Box 242, Gardena, CA  
          90247), written in 1939 by Dr. Julian Johnson, a theologian 
          and surgeon who spent the last years of his life in India 
          studying under and closely observing the Sant Mat Master of 
          that time, Maharaj Sawan Singh Ji. 
    
               Several of the Eckankar books, including some authored 
          by Sri Paul Twitchell or Sri Harold Klemp, can be found in 
          most public and university libraries and some book stores, or 
          obtained thru inter-library loan.  The book "ECKANKAR--THE 
          KEY TO SECRET WORLDS", by Sri Paul Twitchell, is ANOTHER 
          classic. 
    
               Many Christians are likely to confuse the Masters with 
          the "Anti-Christ", which is or was to be a temporary world 
          dictator during the so-called "last days".  But the Masters 
          don't ever rule, even when asked or expected to do so as 
          Jesus was. 
    
               People who continue following Christianity, Islam, or 
          other orthodox religions with a physically-DEAD Master, will 
          CONTINUE on their cycles of REincarnation, between the 
          Psychic Planes and this MISERABLE physical world, until they 
          finally accept Initiation from a PHYSICALLY-LIVING Divine 
          Master. 
    
          
    
          RE-INCARNATION
          
               The book "HERE AND HEREAFTER", by Ruth Montgomery, 
          describes several kinds of evidence supporting REincarnation 
          as a FACT OF LIFE, including HYPNOTIC REGRESSIONS to past 
          lives [about 50% accurate; the subconscious mind sometimes 
          makes things up, especially with a bad hypnotist], 
          SPONTANEOUS RECALL (especially by young children, some of 
          whom can identify their most recent previous relatives, 
          homes, possessions, etc.), DREAM RECALL of past life experi-
          ences, DEJA VU (familiarity with a far off land while travel-
          ing there for the first time on vacation), the psychic read-
          ings of the late EDGAR CAYCE, and EVEN SUPPORTING STATEMENTS 
          FROM THE CHRISTIAN BIBLE including Matthew 17:11-13 (John the 
          Baptist was the REINCARNATION of Elias.) and John 9:1-2 (How 
          can a person POSSIBLY sin before he is born, unless he LIVED 
          BEFORE?!).  [ ALWAYS use the "KING JAMES VERSION".  Later 
          versions are PER-VERSIONS! ] 
          
               Strong INTERESTS, innate TALENTS, strong PHOBIAS, etc., 
          typically originate from a person's PAST LIVES.  For example, 
          a strong fear of swimming in or traveling over water usually 
          results from having DROWNED at the end of a PREVIOUS LIFE.  
          And sometimes a person will take AN IMMEDIATE DISLIKE to 
          another person being met for the first time in THIS life, 
          because of a bad encounter with him during a PREVIOUS 
          INCARNATION. 

               The teaching of REincarnation also includes the LAW OF 
          KARMA (Galatians 6:7, Revelation 13:10, etc.).  People would 
          behave much better toward each other if they knew that their 
          actions in the present will surely be reaped by them in the 
          future, or in a FUTURE INCARNATION! 



          "2nd COMINGS"

               If a Divine Master physically dies ("translates") 
          before a particular Initiate of His does, then when that 
          Initiate physically dies ("translates"), the Master will meet 
          him on the Astral level and take him directly to the Soul 
          Plane.  This is the ONE AND ONLY correct meaning of a 2nd 
          Coming.  It is an INDIVIDUAL experience, NOT something that 
          happens for everyone all at once.  People who are still 
          waiting for Jesus' "2nd Coming" are WAITING IN VAIN. 
    
          
          
          PLANES OF EXISTENCE

               The physical universe is the LOWEST of at least a DOZEN 
          major levels of existence.  Above the Physical Plane is the 
          Astral Plane, the Causal Plane, the Mental Plane, the Etheric 
          Plane (often counted as the upper part of the Mental Plane), 
          the Soul Plane, and several higher Spiritual Planes.  The 
          Soul Plane is the FIRST TRUE HEAVEN, (counting upward from 
          the Physical).  The planes between (but NOT including) the 
          Physical and Soul Planes are called the Psychic Planes. 
    
               It is likely that ESP, telepathy, astrological 
          influences, radionic effects, biological transmutations [See 
          the 1972 book with that title.], and other phenomena without 
          an apparent physical origin, result from INTERACTIONS between 
          the Psychic Planes and the Physical Plane. 
    
               The major planes are also SUB-DIVIDED.  For example, a 
          sub-plane of the Astral Plane is called "Hades", and the 
          Christian Hell occupies a SMALL part of it, created there 
          LESS THAN 2000 YEARS AGO by the EARLY CATHOLIC CHURCH by some 
          kind of black magic or by simply teaching its existence in a 
          THREATENING manner.  The Christian "Heaven" is located 
          elsewhere on the Astral Plane.  Good Christians will go there 
          for a short while and then REincarnate back to Earth. 
          
          
          
          SOUND CURRENT vs. BLIND FAITH

               The Christian religion demands of its followers an 
          extraordinary amount of BLIND FAITH backed up by little more 
          than GOOD FEELING (which is TOTALLY DECEIVING). 
       
               If a person is not HEARING some form of the "SOUND 
          CURRENT" ("THE WORD", "THE BANI", "THE AUDIBLE LIFE STREAM"), 
          then his cycles of REINCARNATION in this MISERABLE world WILL 
          CONTINUE. 
    
               The "SOUND CURRENT" manifests differently for different 
          Initiates, and can sound like a rushing wind, ocean waves on 
          the sea shore, buzzing bees, higher-pitched buzzing sound, a 
          flute, various heavenly music, or other sounds.  In Eckankar, 
          Members start hearing it near the end of their first year as 
          a Member.  This and other experiences (such as "SOUL TRAVEL") 
          REPLACE blind faith.

Since the digital transmission schemes include error correction and
concealment, the performance remains about the same down to a very low
carrier-to-noise ratio, below which it degrades very quickly.  Hence,
digitally compressed TV is supposed to be less susceptible to interference
than amplitude modulated TV.

RELEASE:  93-76

HUBBLE TELESCOPE SERVICING MISSION SCHEDULED FOR ELEVEN DAYS

	The December flight of Endeavour on Space Shuttle mission STS-61 to
service the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) has been scheduled as an 11 day
mission designed to accommodate a record five spacewalks with the capability
for an additional two, if needed.

	The decision to schedule five extravehicular activities, or EVAs, was
reached following extensive evaluations of underwater training, maneuver times
required using the Shuttle's robot arm based on software simulations and actual
EVA tasks on previous missions.

	"Basically what we've done by going to five EVAs rather than three is
to repackage our margin so that we have the capability to respond to the
dynamics, or unknowns, of spacewalks," Mission Director Randy Brinkley said.
"It improves the probabilities for mission success while providing added
flexibility and adaptability for reacting to real-time situations."

	In laying out the specific tasks to be completed on each of the
spacewalks, officials have determined that changing out the gyros, solar arrays
and the Wide Field/Planetary Camera (WF/PC) and installing the Corrective
Optics Space Telescope Axial Replacement (COSTAR) are priority objectives
during the mission.

	"When we looked at accomplishing all of the tasks, highest through
lowest priority, and recognizing that the major tasks -- gyros, solar arrays,
WF/PC and COSTAR -- would consume most of the time set aside for each
spacewalk, five EVAs were deemed appropriate," said Milt Heflin, Lead Flight
Director for the mission.

	While the five spacewalks will be unprecedented, the use of two
alternating spacewalk teams will alleviate placing more stress on the crew than
previous missions requiring two, three or four EVAs.

	"We have paid close attention to lessons learned during previous
spacewalks and factored these into our timeline estimates for five EVAs,"
Heflin said.  "In planning for all Space Shuttle missions, it is necessary to
formulate a work schedule that represents as realistic a timeline as possible
to accomplish the mission objectives."

	Planning currently calls for at least five water tank training sessions
that include support from the Mission Control Center, called joint integrated
simulations, lasting between 10 and 36 hours.  In addition, many stand alone
underwater training "runs" will practice individual tasks in each spacewalk.

	Various refinements to the specific tasks on each spacewalk will be
made based on actual training experience during the months prior to the
mission.  Also, lessons learned from other spacewalks leading up to the flight
will be valuable in assisting the STS-61 crew in its training techniques.

	Endeavour's June flight and Discovery's July mission both will include
spacewalks to evaluate some of the unique tools to be used on the HST mission.
The evaluations will help in better understanding the differences between the
actual weightlessness of space and the ground training in the water tanks at
the Johnson Space Center, Houston, and the Marshall Space Flight Center,
Huntsville, Ala.

	Also, the inflight spacewalking experiences will assist in gaining
further insight into the time required for the various tasks and expand the
experience levels among the astronaut corps, the flight controllers and
trainers.

	Designed to be serviced by a Space Shuttle crew, Hubble was built with
grapple fixtures and handholds to assist in the capture and repair procedures.

	The telescope was launched aboard Discovery in April 1990.  At that
time the NASA mixed fleet manifest showed the first revisit mission to HST in
1993 to change out science instruments and make any repairs that may have
become necessary.

       There are a couple of ways to look at them.  One is, "We want
you to support this Constitution, so we'll say anything that we think
will appeal to you," or the more straightforward, "This is why we think
what we've suggested in this Constitution is a good idea."

       You clearly consider the former to be the primary situation.

       Well, I know Hamilton was a dyed in the wool monarchist, and 
probably the authoritarian extreme to Jefferson's democratic impules.
But what would you suggest as a means of determining their opinions
on the government if we don't consider what they wrote about the
government?

       And is writing in support of something automatically "propoganda"
to the point we must assume it is untrue or that they are saying what
they don't believe?

       If the Senate was less powerful than the House of Lords, than
we'd almost have to state that the House of Representatives was also.
(In fact, they both were, because the British government had much
greater power than did the American system).

       I disagree.  The system is not too slow, it was simply designed to
handle less than it has demanded that it handle.  As somebody in Washington
put it (whose name I forget), "Congress has become everybody's city
council."

       Congress is more than capable of quick action, and has more than
enough power and time on its hands, if it confined itself to what its
original jurisidiction was and allowed more local autonomy.

       It is not a case of the system of government they created failing,
but that it is operating under a set of conditions they specifically
wanted to avoid.  Namely, a concentration of power.  It would seem
then that the proper thing to do is not to reduce the power of either
House in some attempt to grease the wheels.  All you'll get then is
a system which moves quicker to do stupid things.  It would make more
sense to make more decisions at a local level.

       Please explain to me how Bush abused the veto in an "extraordinary"
manner.

>The veto was clearly regarded

>preventing the legislature interfering with the actions of the executive.

       I fail to see where any restrictions, implied or otherwise, were
placed on the veto.  It could just as easily have been read as a means
to put a check on democratically popular but unwise (in the executive's
opinion) policies.  

       There is no limit in the Constitution to the President's veto power
regarding what a bill is for.  Previous Presidents have used the veto
for any number of reasons, most usually having something to do with their
agenda.  I am really curious how you single Bush out as *the* President
who abused vetos.

       Why is it not a reasonable restriction?  Because 51 Senators
is the magic holy number upon which Laws must be based?  If 41 Senators
feel safe enough with their state constituencies to stand up and 
fillibuster isn't that *enough* to indicate there's a sufficient question
as to whether a law is a good idea or not to re-evaluate it?

       Why one earth *should* 51% be sufficient to enact a law which
covers 250 million people in very, very diverse places and living
in radically different conditions?  Why *shouldn't* a super-majority
be required?

       Any system in which the simple majority is given absolute power
to ignore the minority then the minority *will* be ignored.  I do not
see this as a positive thing.  And for all that I'm sure the Republicans
are looking for pork as much as the Democrats, they've got some legitimate
objections to the legislation in question.

Of course.  The feast WAS the Seder, and the accounts of it are very clear
on this point.

The difference is the connection between the bread and wine and the body
and blood of god.  This is an old association of the Tammuz/Osiris/Mithras
line, and not really related to Judaism.  In any case, I didn't really
intend to argue the point.  I saw a possible association and pointed it
out, but I haven't the foggiest notion what really happened.

Yes.

I use 74HC4066 and others commerically for this purpose so rest assured it 
works fine. In one case I route bit serial digital audio using these and it 
is difficult to see any signal degradation at all which surprised me given 
some pretty fast edges. HC4066 is spec'd at something like -3dB @ 200MHz into 
50 ohms. The more complex types are generally a little slower and more 
resistive.

Plain 4000 series are not so good at handling 5v logic.

Remember that the output load is seen by the input device.

I agree with most of what Phill says, except the point about it being in
our interests to bring down the oil price.  Consider that both the U.S.
and Great Britain have domestic sources to partly satisfy 
their energy needs.    Pricy OPEC oil impacts both Germany,
Japan and many other "industrial rivals" more than these two.  
In addition, the proceeds from the sale (especially by Saudi Arabia, Kuwait
U.A.E. etc) are disproportionately reinvested in the U.S. and G.B., 
propping up these economies and further providing an incentive 
to keep prices from falling too low.

	Uh oh...
	Umm, there are a number of copy protection schemes.  Some involve
modifying the physical media, and some involve encryption schemes, &c.
	All of the ones that have existed over the course of computing have
been successful for a time.  I recall, however, near monthly releases of new
ways to "crack" the copy protection scheme of the latest releases.  The fact
is, none of them are completely secure, or anywhere near it.  Some are more or
less difficult to crack, and some have already been cracked.
	I guess what I am saying is that your question is difficult, if not
impossible, to answer.  What exactly do you want to know?  Do you need a good
one for a project you are working on?  How secure must it be?  Are you trying
to crack one that someone else has used?  I can probably make suggestions,
assuming the activity is strictly legal.  (In general, it is a BAD idea,
legally, to tamper with copy protection.  It can also lead to corruption of
files which you necessarily do not have back ups of (being as they are copy
protected,) which can be devestating.)  Do you have absolutely no ideas for
practical applications, and are merely curious?
	Please clear up those questions, and I'll try to help as much as I
can.

	Incidentally, the "Uh oh..." at the top is indicative of the dread
anyone who has watched their friends hacking equipment be carted off feels
when they are asked how to hack.  The area you are broaching is wrought with
dangers, many of which include breaking the law, or at least addressing it
(from one side or the other.)

     What kind of brainless clod doesn't understand the difference 
     between a "PROPOSED BILL, BLOCKED IN CONGRESS" and an "EXECUTIVE
     ORDER, ISSUED BY CLINTON, AND CRAMMED DOWN OUR THROATS".

     
  Here, let me give a remedial course in thinking:

     In order to create the appearance of low interest rates, Uncle Sam
     has shifted his debt from long-term to short-term securities.

     In effect, Uncle Sam has transformed the Federal Goverment into
     one giant S&L, waiting to blow.

     Short-term rates rise --->  Interest payments on Deficit rise --->

That's absurd! That statement must therefore say that any argument in favor
of seatbelts or airbags is an argument against automobiles.  Any argument
for lifeguards is an argument against swimming.  It says that any agrgument
in favor of safety precautions is an argument for banning the activity to 
which the precautions apply.  Extrapolating to that degree is ridiculous,
there wouldn't be any normal human activity left to do; therefore it is
a non-seqitur.

Also, even though most people do not ride motorcycles, they do boat, sail,
jetski, climb, ski, fly parachute, hang-glide, glide, bungee-jump, bike,
skate, rollerblade, skateboard, play rugby (ouch), mow the lawn, rewire
the basement, operate heavy machinery,  and do a host of other 'dangerous'
things that would all be as valid as motorcycling as activities to ban.
Your little homily applies to all those things, and the general public
buying into banning motorcycles without realizing that their activity
would be next is unlikely.

Well yes and no. The Federalist papers are propaganda and it is therefore
difficult to determine precisely what Maddison etc were up to from them. They
certainly emphasised a limited role for the federal government but this

The Senate was less powerful than the House of Lords in the period in question.
The stripping of the powers of the House of Lords did not occur until 1914
and David Llloyd George's budget. Even despite this the House of Lords has
considerable power even today and is far from a rubber stamping body.

The system is meant to be slow to react, the problem is that it ended up
a bit too slow.

The Presiden't veto was meant to be entirely separate. Until Bush abused it
in a quite extraordinary manner it was used more in accord with the intent
of being a check on unreasonable legislation. The veto was clearly regarded 
as a completely last gasp measure its use was meant to be restricted to
preventing the legislature interfering with the actions of the executive.

the Senate is not meant to be exactly a rubber stamp body, it is meant as
a check on unrestrained legislation. That is the extra measure built into
the constitution in favour of the status quo, 60% of the representatives
of the states is not a reasonable restriction.

Oh, you foolish person.  I do know what the fuck I'm talking about
and will gladly demonstrate for such ignorants as yourself if you

The legalization of drugs will provide few if any of the benefits
so highly taunted by its proponents:  safer, cheaper drugs along
with revenues from taxes on those drugs; reduced crime and reduced
organized crime specifically; etc, etc

If you would like to prove how clueless you are, we can get into
why - again a lot of wasted posts that I don't think this group
was intended for and something easily solved by you doing a little
research.

Unfortunately, there's not much we can learn from the statistics presented
here either.  Due to rounding, the 1991 est. for LSD could be anywhere
from .550 to .649 and the 1992 est. could be anywhere from .850 to .949.
This means that the actual change (if you believe these statistics in the
first place) was anywhere from 31% to 73%.  Similarly the increase in
cocaine use could be anywhere from 18% to 66% and the increase of
crack use could be anywhere from 29% to 120%.  This doesn't even
take into account the margin of error which isn't provided here.

This does not mean that the rest of the argument you present is unfounded,
but it does mean that USA Today has (not surprisingly) provided us
with virtually no information.

It wasn't especially prominent, as I recall.  However, quite possibly it's
no longer on display; NASM, like most museums, has much more stuff than it
can display at once, and does rotate the displays occasionally.

No one is a "rioter" until they participate in a "riot", which is 
unlikely to happen, now.

Most of the *people* in L.A. are likely to have gotten up early to 
listen to the court announcement.

The ice princess next door makes a habit of flooring her cage out of the 
driveway when she sees me coming. Probably only hits 25mph, or so. (I made 
the mistake of waving to a neighbor. She has some sort of grudge, now.)

I was riding downhill at ~60mph on a local backroad when a brown dobie came 
flashing through the brush at well over 30mph, on an intercept course with 
my front wheel. The dog had started out at the top of the hill when it heard 
me and still had a lead when it hit the road. The dog was approaching from 
my left, and was running full tilt to get to my bike on the other side of 
the road before I went by. Rover was looking back at me to calculate the 
final trajectory. Too bad it didn't notice the car approaching at 50+mph 
from the other direction.

I got a closeup view of the our poor canine friend's noggin careening off 
the front bumper, smacking the asphalt, and getting runover by the front 
tire. It managed a pretty good yelp, just before impact. (peripheral 
imminent doom?) I guess the driver didn't see me or they probably would have 
swerved into my lane. The squeegeed pup actually got up and headed back 
home, but I haven't seen it since. 

Sniff.

Wrong.  We need its capability.  Sure it has its problems, very few
airplanes haven't, but getting rid of something we need is not the
answer.  What do you want to do, start over a rebuild a new airplane

  Government-Mandated Energy Conservation is Unnecessary and Wastful, Study Finds

  Washington, DC -- The energy tax and subsidized energy-efficiency
  measures supported by President Clinton and Energy Secretary Hazel
  O'Leary are based on faulty assumptions, a new study from the Cato
  Institute points out.

    According to Jerry Taylor, Cato's director of natural resource studies,
  we are not running out of sources of energy. The world now has almost 10
  times the proven oil reserves it had in 1950 and twice the reserves of
  1970. Proven reserves of coal and natural gas have increased just as
  dramatically.

    When standards of living, population densities, and industrial
  structures are controlled for, the United States is no less energy
  efficient than Japan and more energy efficient than many of the Group
  of Seven nations.

    Energy independence provides little protection against domestic oil
  price shocks because the energy economy is global. Moreover, since the
  cost of oil represents only about 2 percent of gross national product,
  even large increases in the price of oil would have little impact on the
  overall U.S. economy.

    Market economies are, on average, 2.75 times more energy efficient per
  $1,000 of GNP than are centrally planned economies.

    Utilities' subsidized energy-efficiency measurs, known as demand-side
  management programs, encourage free riders, overuse of competing resource
  inputs, an competitive inequities. Furthermore, DSM programs do not
  reduce demand.

    Taylor concludes that government-mandated energy conservation imposes
  unnecessary costs on consumers and wastes, not conserves, energy; that
  subsidizing energy-conservation technologies will stymie, not advance,
  gains in energy conservation; and that central control over the lifeblood
  of modern society--energy--would transfer tremendous power to the state
  at the expense of the individual.

    "Energy Conservation and Efficiency: The Case Against Coercion" is no.

                        The Cato Institute

    Founded in 1977, the Cato Institute is a public policy research
  foundation dedicated to broadening the parameters of policy debate
  to allow consideration of more options that are consistent with the
  traditional American principles of limited government, individual
  liberty, and peace.  To that end, the Institute strives to achieve
  greater involvement of the intelligent, concerned lay public in 
  questions of policy and the proper role of government.
    The Institute is named for Cato's Letters, libertarian pamphlets
  that were widely read in the American Colonies in the early 18th
  century and played a major role in laying the philosophical foundation
  of the American Revolution.
    Despite the achievement of the nation's Founders, today virtually
  no aspect of life is free from government encroachment.  A pervasive
  intolerance for individual rights is shown by government's arbitrary
  intrusions into private economic transactions and its disregard for
  civil liberties.
    To counter that trend the Cato Institute undertakes an extensive
  publications program that addresses the complete spectrum of policy
  issues.  Books, monographs, and shorter studies are commissioned
  to examine the federal budget, Social Security, regulation, military
  spending, international trade, and myriad other issues.  Major policy
  conferences are held throughout the year, from which papers are
  published thrice yearly in the Cato Journal.
    In order to maintain its independence, the Cato Institute accepts
  no government funding.  Contributions are received from foundations,
  corporations, and individuals, and other revenue is generated from
  the sale of publications.  The Institute is a nonprofit, tax-exempt,
  educational foundation under Section 501(c)3 of the Internal Revenue
  Code.

Look at the 4053.  This is a triple 2-to-1 transmission-gate analog
multiplexer, with positive and negative power supplies (can be run
from a single-ended supply as well).  With dual supplies, the logic
inputs still range from ground (0 Volts) to VDD.

This is a neat (well, I think so) design for a switchable-polarity
amplifier:

                 +-----/\/\/\-------+
                 |                  |
                 |    /--------\    |
INPUT -+-/\/\/\--+----| -      |    |
       |              |  opamp |----+------- OUTPUT
       +-/\/\/\--+----| +      |
                 |    \--------/
                 |
CONTROL	---------X (analog switch)
                 |
                 |
                ---
                GND

All resistors are equal-value.  When the analog switch is closed,
the amp is inverting-gain-of-one.  With the switch open, it is
non-inverting-gain-of-one.  You can clean up the circuit to trim
out input offset current if this hurts the balance (this would show
up as carrier feed-through).

For high frequencies, the slew-rate of the opamp might cause problems,
especially if it isn't symmetrical (and it usually isn't).

would help me in my search, including places to look or even specific
bikes that you want to sell me.

Sell the bike and the car and start taking the bus. That way you can
keep drinking which seems to be where your priorities lay.

I expect that enough of us on this list have lost friends because of
driving drunks that our collective sympathy will be somewhat muted.

 Whacha mean 'we'...ifin they (whom ever 'they' are) want to stereotype me
as one that likes to drink beer and watch lovely ladies display their
beautiful bodies - I like that stereotype.
  If you were refering 'stereotype' to infer a negative - you noticed we

                          Speech by Pete Worden
                                    
          Delivered Before the U.S. Space Foundation Conference
                                    
                       Colorado Springs, Colorado
                                    
                             April 15, 1993


     What a delightful opportunity to cause some trouble.  For
providing me this forum I would sincerely like to thank the U.S.
Space Foundation.  My topic today is the Single Stage Rocket
Technology rocket or SSRT.  By I intend to speak of more.  How to
lower the cost and make rapid progress.  SSRT is to my mind --
and I hope to convince you -- the erupting a new rallying cry for
our generation in space -- Faster, Cheaper, and Better.

     Faster, Cheaper, Better and SSRT represent the passing of a
torch from one technical generation to another.  It is a new
thing to be sure -- but it is also a relearning of old things
from past masters.

     When we rolled out the SSRT baby two weeks ago, so called
experts told us it violates the laws of physics -- it made no
sense.  For example, Dr. Eberhart Rachtin - former president of
the Aerospace Corp., said of SSRT in the L.A. Times that it,
"defies the best principles of launching payloads into space." 
Well Dr. Rachtin -- you've made us mad!  What are these
principles that SSRT defies?

     Well I'll tell you.  It violates the principle that you need
a giant program office to build space hardware.  It violates the
"fact" that it takes 20 years to build something new.  And it
violates the truism that you cant do anything significant for
less than many billions of dollars.

     It took some of the last generation's experts to teach us
some new/old lessons.  Werhner Von Braun's first rocket was not a
Saturn V.  General Schriever's ICBM's didn't take ten years to
demonstrate.  And the X-1 airplane didn't cost $1 billion.

     It took one of the great engineers of the 1950's to remind
us of these truths -- Max Hunter.  Max, to remind you, was a
senior engineer in the Thor IRBM program, and old faster, better,
cheaper success story.  Max has been persistent in a vision of a
single stage reusable space launch system since the 1960's. 
Because he knew it had to be done in affordable steps - Build a
little, Test a little.

     Next he persuaded us to do a technology demonstration.  We
didn't solicit a bunch of requirements -- they'd just change
every few years anyway.  [ not included in the speech -- The
ALS/NLS has such ephemeral requirements that it would better
known as "Shape Shifter" than "Space Lifter."  We didn't spend a
lot money -- this X-Rocket only cost $60 million.  When's the
last time we even built a new airplane for that?  And it didn't
take a lot of time to build -- McDonnell Douglas completed it in
18 months.  Finally, the government program office consisted of
one very over-worked Air Force Major -- motivated in part by the
threat that he'd get to ride on it in a strapped-on lawn chair if
it ran over cost or schedule.

     As I described what SSRT is -- and isn't keep in mind its
only a first step.  There are several more steps -- and steps
that can easily fail -- before the U.S. can field an SSTO.  But
each step should follow the same principles -- a small management
team -- a few years technology demonstration -- and a modest
budget.

     Let me show a few details on SSRT and how it might evolve:
(See charts)

     I'm embarrassed when my generation is compared with the last
generation -- the giants of the last great space era, the 1950's
and 1960's.  They went to the moon - we built a telescope that
can't see straight.  They soft-landed on Mars - the least we
could do is soft-land on Earth!

     But we do have an answer.  We can follow their build a
little, test a little philosophy to produce a truly affordable
and routine access to space.  I know there are nay sayers among
you -- those who say SSRT is a stunt.  It needs more thermal
protection, the engines are wrong, it would be better to land
horizontally, etc, etc.

     I say to you -- we'll see you at White Sands in June.  You
bring your view-graphs, and I'll bring my rocketship.  If we do
what we say we can do, then you let us do the next step.  [ not
included in the speech:  If we fail -- you still have your
program offices, staff summary sheets, requirement analyses, and
decade long programs.]

     I bet on my generation and Max Hunter's idea -- Any Takers?

                 TEXT OF A LETTER FROM THE PRESIDENT
                        TO THE SPEAKER OF THE
                    HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES AND
               THE PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE OF THE SENATE
  
  
                           April 13, 1993
  
  
  Dear Mr. Speaker:      (Dear Mr. President:)
  
  As part of my continuing effort to keep the Congress fully 
  informed, I am providing this report, consistent with section 4 
  of the War Powers Resolution, to advise you of actions that I 
  have ordered in support of the United Nations efforts in 
  Bosnia-Herzegovina.
  
  Beginning with U.N. Security Council Resolution 713 of 
  September 25, 1991, the United Nations has been actively 
  addressing the crisis in the former Yugoslavia.  The Security 
  Council acted in Resolution 781 to establish a ban on all 
  unauthorized military flights over Bosnia-Herzegovina.  There 
  have, however, been blatant violations of the ban, and villages 
  in Bosnia have been bombed.
  
  In response to these violations, the Security Council decided, 
  in Resolution 816 of March 31, 1993, to extend the ban to all 
  unauthorized flights over Bosnia-Herzegovina and to authorize 
  Member States, acting nationally or through regional organi-
  zations, to take all necessary measures to ensure compliance.  
  NATO's North Atlantic Council (NAC) agreed to provide NATO air 
  enforcement for the no-fly zone.  The U.N. Secretary General 
  was notified of NATO's decision to proceed with Operation DENY 
  FLIGHT, and an activation order was delivered to participating 
  allies.
  
  The United States actively supported these decisions.  At my 
  direction, the Joint Chiefs of Staff sent an execute order to 
  all U.S. forces participating in the NATO force, for the conduct 
  of phased air operations to prevent flights not authorized by 
  the United Nations over Bosnia-Herzegovina.  The U.S. forces 
  initially assigned to this operation consist of 13 F-15 and 
  12 F-18A fighter aircraft and supporting tanker aircraft.  
  These aircraft commenced enforcement operations at 8:00 a.m. 
  e.d.t. on April 12, 1993.  The fighter aircraft are equipped for 
  combat to accomplish their mission and for self-defense.
  
  NATO has positioned forces and has established combat air 
  patrol (CAP) stations within the control of Airborne Early 
  Warning (AEW) aircraft.  The U.S. CAP aircraft will normally 
  operate from bases in Italy and from an aircraft carrier in the 
  Adriatic Sea.  Unauthorized aircraft entering or approaching 
  the no-fly zone will be identified, interrogated, intercepted, 
  escorted/monitored, and turned away (in that order).  If these 
  steps do not result in compliance with the no-fly zone, such 
  aircraft may be engaged on the basis of proper authorization by 
  NATO military authorities and in accordance with the approved

  rules of engagement, although we do not expect such action will 
  be necessary.  The Commander of UNPROFOR (the United Nations 
  Protection Force currently operating in Bosnia-Herzegovina) was 
  consulted to ensure that his concerns for his force were fully 
  considered before the rules of engagement were approved.
  
  It is not possible to predict at this time how long such 
  operations will be necessary.  I have directed U.S. armed forces 
  to participate in these operations pursuant to my constitutional 
  authority as Commander in Chief.  I am grateful for the con-
  tinuing support that the Congress has given to this effort, and 
  I look forward to continued cooperation as we move forward 
  toward attainment of our goals in this region.

I happen to take the violation of a person much more seriously than the
"violation" of a mindless clump of cells smaller than my thumb.

Your mileage may vary.

Also remember that every dollar spent keeping one spacecraft in safe mode
(probably a spin-stabilized sun-pointing orientation) is a dollar not
spent on mission analysis for a newer spacecraft.  In order to turn the
spacecraft back on, you either need to insure that the Ops guys will be
available, or you need to retrain a new team.

Having said that, there are some spacecraft that do what you have proposed.
Many of the operational satellites Goddard flies (like the Tiros NOAA 
series) require more than one satellite in orbit for an operational set.
Extras which get replaced on-orbit are powered into a "standby" mode for
use in an emergency.  In that case, however, the same ops team is still
required to fly the operational birds; so the standby maintenance is
relatively cheap.

Finally, Pat's explanation (some spacecraft require continuous maintenance
to stay under control) is also right on the mark.  I suggested a spin-
stabilized control mode because it would require little power or 
maintenance, but it still might require some momentum dumping from time
to time.

In the end, it *is* a political decision (since the difference is money),
but there is some technical rationale behind the decision.

Prestone.  I buy it at ShopKo for less 
than that a _gallon_.    BMW has even more
expensive stuff than Kawasaki (must be 
from grapes only grown in certain parts of
the fatherland), but BMW Dave* said "Don't 
worry about it -- just change it yearly and
keep it topped off".  It's been keeping 
Gretchen happy  since '87, so I guess it's OK.

Kept my Rabbit's aluminum radiator hoppy for
12 years and 130,000 miles, too, so I guess
it's aluminum safe.

Here's the scoop.  When you get your home brew receiver working, would
you be willing to share it with the rest of us?  I always wanted to
build my own but never have the time to fool around and design it.

pin 1:  signal ground
pin 2:  signal
pin 3:  always hot +6 volts
pin 4:  +6 volts, hot only when preamp is turned on
pin 5:  infrared repeater connectors

The infrared repeater jacks on the back of the preamp are not connected
to anything inside the preamp except the 5 pin connector pin #5.  There
is a 150 ohm resistor between the two jacks, with a 1.5K from pin 5 to
ground.

The signal pin #2 in the preamp is summed with the built in IR receiver.
They use a chip called CX20106A and a BJT to amplify the signal.  I would
imagine the logical way would be to duplicate this circuit and use
it as the external receiver.

If you need more info, let me know.

Actually, jon, that is quite true.  Christian people have caused
"objective morality" to look very "relative."  After all, that was the
point of the original question in this thread, i.e. can we toss out
Christianity because it is so obviously inconsistent with its own
principles?  If you will bear with me, I will attempt to explain this
apparent inconsistency from at least one Christian's viewpoint:

If God exists and is the creator of mankind as the Bible claims, then
He has a pretty well-defined concept of what makes people tick
physically, emotionally, etc.  GOD has an "objective" morality for us.
That is to say, He has no trouble understanding what is good for (or
detrimental to) the creature He created. 

	Galatians 2:10-- For we [mankind] are His workmanship, created in
	Christ Jesus for good works [a morality], which God prepared
	beforehand [a well-defined design], that we might walk in them.

However, contrary to what many people assume (including the Pharasees
of the Bible,) God's morality cannot be completely codified in a list
of rules and regulations.  To some extent, every activity of a
person's life creates a new situation to which morality must be
applied.  There never could be enough volumes to codify God's
"objective" morality for us. 

Throughout history, mankind has tried to reduce morality to a list of
rules (objectivity, if you please.)  In the Old Testament, we have
both principles and specific rules.  By the time of Jesus, most of the
principles were obscured by the emphasis men had placed on the rules.
Volumes of additional rules had been made to try to codify the
application of the principles.  We [mankind] weren't comfortable with
the "subjectivity" of principles. 

	For reference see Matthew 5 where Jesus explains the difference
	between the Law and the principles of the Law.  For example, in
	verses 21-22:  "You have heard that the ancients were told,
	'You shall not commit murder'...and 'Whoever commits murder shall
	be liable to the court.'  But I say to you that everyone who is
	angry with his brother shall be liable to the court..."

The "objective morality" of God gets blurred by our inept
interpretation of it.  We [Christians] have made our biggest errors
when we have allowed any one person or group of people decide EXACTLY
what God intended for us.  If we [Christians] would stay committed to
seeking God's will instead of trying to prove we already had it all
figured out, we might do a better job of allowing others to find God's
"objective morality" for themselves.  If Jesus is who he said he
was/is (and that's the fundamental question,) then HE IS "objective
morality."

This graphic depicts chlorine monoxide and ozone over Earth's
northern hemisphere in February 1992 and 1993.  These maps were
produced by the Microwave Limb Sounder aboard the Upper
Atmosphere Research Satellite.  The chlorine monoxide (ClO) maps
(left) are for a layer about 20 kilometers (66,000 feet) above
the Earth's surface on February 17, 1992 (above) and 1993
(below).  The ozone maps show the total amount above an altitude
of about 12 kilometers (41,000 feet) averaged over the period
from February 15 to March 6 for the two years.  The Microwave
Limb Sounder, developed and operated by a team at NASA's Jet

ozone hole.  These maps, produced by the Microwave Limb Sounder
aboard the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite, show the amount
of chlorine monoxide (left) and ozone (right) in the stratosphere
at altitudes above 20 kilometers (66,000 feet).  Very small
abundances of ozone appear where there are large abundances of
chlorine monoxide, the dominant form of chlorine that destroys
ozone.  Data from September 21, 1991 (top) are compared with

You forget that Apollo was a Government program and had to start 
relatively from scratch. Some people at NASA think that this could work. 
One of them replied to me personally after I posted this original message

If you see a 8551 made by MOS or CSG, take it, its a 6551A.

I know no fixed version of the 6551. There are different possibilities
to work around this bug. The easiest is to tie _CTS to GND and
use _DSR or _DCD as _CTS. It should be easy to fix the software,
_DSR is bit 6 and DCD ist bit 5 of the Status Register (Read 6551
with RS1 = low and RS0 = high).

Using the _CTS-line can lead into big trouble. The 6551 _instantly_
stops transmission if _CTS goes high. This means, that you may
get only a half byte...

Gee, the War on Drugs has been going on for all these years and they're

My friends who like grass (I don;t agree but it's pretty harmless) are

The War on Drugs has been completely unsuccessful, yet it's lead to really

I know this is just setting myself up, but this is actually one of the

heard practically no one steals BMWs. Probably it is similar for Moto

for parts and the bike would be much easier to track down. It seems
that the most stolen bikes are Harleys and 600cc Jap sport bikes.

Growth limits?  How will HSR help with the traffic congestion?  From what
I understand, the rail will not stop in places like Waco, or Bryan, or
lots of intermediate places in between.  Even though I live in Austin,
I don't see myself using the train except on rare occasions.  probably
twice a year.  And at $65 dollars a ticket I could probably drive for 
cheaper also. (even if the price of gas went up)

Those areas became states.

Puerto Rico has the population needed to become a state.  But the ethnic
mix there is such that Puerto Rico will probably never become a state.

I say we cut them loose.  If they don't want to become a state, we
shouldn't continue to subsidize their existence.

Well, there are two approaches we can take here.  One is to ask you what this
objective morality is, assuming it's not a secret.

The other is to ask you what you think is wrong with relativism, so that we
can correct your misconceptions :-)

Dr. Tahir Ijaz comments on Esam Abdel-Rahem's statement:

The argument by Jawad Ali is funny, He writes:
"The converse would be that the problem is that Muslims dont consider
Ahmadies to be Muslims"

Which is a wrong statement. In the light of Dr. Ijaz's statement, the
above statement should be corrected:
".......................................is that (some) non-Ahmadi Muslims
don't consider Ahmadi-Muslims as Muslims"

So, the problem does not get solved:-) Who is a muslims and who is not?
Humans cannot decide. Humans may not declare others faiths. Its that 
simple. I don't understand, why the mere use of the word "ISLAM" is
becomming such a big issue. I have seen numorous postings on the net
on this subject, and all they say, "No, NO, you cannot use ISLAM as 
the name of your newsgroup". ?? 

I haven't seen a single posting stating what right do they have in declaring
the name of other's faiths? Who gives them this authority? Quran? or
Hadith? or something else? I want to know this! 

Just a small reminder to all my Muslim Brothers, Did _EVER_ the 
Holy Prophet of Islam (Muhammad PBUH), say to anyone who called
himself a Muslim:

No, You are not a Muslim ! ???????

NEVER! I challenge all my Muslim brothers to produce a single 
such evidence from the history of Islam!

Hence, if the Prophet Muhammad could never do that to anyone, how
could the Muslims, Mullahs or even Governments of today do
it to anyone. Do you consider yourself above the Holy Prophet 
Muhammad (PBUH) ?? 


Sincerely,
Nabeel.

his way to Vietnam to continue working on the MIA-POW issue.  At 
12:30 p.m. he'll have lunch with the Vice President in the Oval 
Office.  And at 2:00 p.m. he'll meet with the police organizations.
Then from 3:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. he'll do his weekly photos with the 
various groups.
	     
	     Q	  A photo op with Vessey?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  There's no coverage on the Vessey meeting.
	     
	     Q	  Why?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  Why?  It's a closed meeting.  
	     
	     Q	  What about the lunch?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  The lunch?  No, there's no coverage.
	     
	     Q	  Is he meeting with any congress people today?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  Nothing scheduled.
	     
	     Q	  There are no meetings --
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  There are no congressional meetings today, 
no.
	     
	     Q	  Has the President been given any information by the 
Pentagon or reached any conclusion about the validity of this report 
from Hanoi?  Any instructions to Vessey on how to deal with the 
Vietnamese on that subject?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  Well, clearly, the report is the first order 
of business.  It's high on the agenda on something that they'll 
discuss.  I think the President and General Vessey will discuss the 
parameters of his visit to Vietnam today, but the President hasn't 
drawn any conclusions about the report yet.  Certainly, it's 
something that he wants General Vessey to talk with the Vietnamese 
about first.
	     
	     Q	  Did the President talk with any Republican senators 
yesterday about the stimulus package?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  He spoke with Senator Dole.
	     
	     Q	  How many times?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I believe once during the day and once last 
night.
	     
	     Q	  What was the outcome of that?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  They're continuing to work toward some kind 
of an agreement on a jobs package.
	     
	     Q	  Is it your impression that Senator Dole is in any 
way flexible on this?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  Well, I think we're hopeful that we're going 
to get some kind of jobs package through the Senate, and we'll 
continue to work with Senator Dole and others until we reach some 
kind of an agreement.
	     
	     Q	  Did they discuss the VAT tax?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I don't know if that came up.
	     
	     Q	  Can you check that?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  Sure.

	     Q	  So what are they -- is the President offering to 
scale down his program -- is that what he's trying to do, buy it down 
to where Dole will sign on?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  Well, he's trying to protect as much of it 
as he can.  But it's important to him to get some kind of a jobs 
package through the Senate and through Congress now.  And as soon as 
we reach some conclusions on that, we'll let you know.  But at the 
moment, he's continuing to consult with members of Congress 
including, obviously, Senator Dole.
	     
	     Q	  Is he talking to anybody else?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I don't believe he talked to any other 
Republicans yesterday.
	     
	     Q	  Is he talking to anybody today?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I don't think anything is scheduled, but I 
wouldn't rule it out.
	     
	     Q	  We were led to believe that the President called 
Mr. Dole on the subject of Russian aid and that Bob Dole brought the 
conversation around to stimulus package.  Is that correct?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I think the President has contacted several 
people on Russian aid.  I think that it was always expected that the 
stimulus package or the jobs package will be part of any conversation 
he would have with Senator Dole.  The primary objective of the 
conversation was Russian aid.  That was the first order of business, 
but it was both.
	     
	     Q	  In the President's mind, are they linked 
politically in that if the Republicans continue to reject the 
stimulus package, he thinks it will be harder to sell Russian aid to 
the American people?  Has he made that argument?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I can't talk about specifically what 
arguments he might have made.  The President is obviously committed 
to both.  He liked to see a jobs package to the American people 
first.  But as you know, we outlined the details of additional 
Russian aid last night in Tokyo.
	     
	     Q	  But does the President believe that the stimulus 
package will make it more difficult to persuade Americans to vote for 
Russian -- to accept a vote for Russian aid?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I think that the President is going to 
continue to work to pass the stimulus package, to pass a jobs 
package, and we're still hopeful that we'll get some kind of jobs 
package through the Congress.
	     
	     Q	  Is it fair to say that the President is negotiating 
now with Dole?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  He's discussing options with him.
	     
	     Q	  On the stimulus, is it your understanding that over 
the break some Democrats, themselves, have left the support that they 
had earlier for the package, the stimulus package?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I think we still have wide support in the 
Senate for the jobs package.
	     
	     Q	  But specifically, that you've lost Democrats other 
than Shelby?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I don't believe so.  There hasn't been a 
vote.
	     
	     Q	  What about Kohl?
	     
	     Q	  Kohl and Feingold?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  There hasn't been a vote yet.  And we'll 
continue to work with senators to try to get a majority to try to 
bring the package to a vote, because we believe that a majority of 
the members of the United States Senate support the package.
	     
	     Q	  If you're weren't worried about Kohl and Feingold, 
why did George mention Milwaukee projects the other day?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I think George pointed out a number of 
projects in a number of states that stand to be funded, or to lose 
funding if this jobs package doesn't pass.
	     
	     Q	  No Democrats.  (Laughter.)
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I'll let you draw your own conclusions.
	     
	     Q	  Does he plan to talk to Dole again today or any 
other Republicans again today?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  There's nothing specifically scheduled, but 
again, I wouldn't rule it out.
	     
	     Q	  Does he plan to put out any more press releases to 
any other states today?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  What we've done is we're in the process of 
breaking down the benefits of the jobs package state by state.  I 
think it's entirely feasible that as we sort of are able to sum those 
up, we'll send out press releases to the various states that suggest 
how their states would benefit from this package.
	     
	     Q	  Will you share those with us?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  Sure.  As we did yesterday.
	     
	     Q	  Do you have copies of the ones you sent --
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  Yes, we made those available yesterday.  And 
we certainly can continue to provide them today.
	     
	     Q	  Dee Dee, since yesterday's questions and subsequent 
stories about the VAT, what further consideration of this issue has 
been given?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  Nothing's changed since yesterday.  I think 
the President commented on it this morning to say only that it was 
something he knew was being considered by the task force and that he 
has not made a decision on, and I don't think we have anything to add 
to that.
	     
	     Q	  But he also said that business and labor groups are 
telling him they support it.  Can you tell us --
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I think that there has been -- I'm not going 
to speculate on who supports it.  I think the President said that 
there has been some support among business and labor groups.  I don't 
think he said he was directly contacted by them.
	     
	     Q	  Are we to take that to mean that the administration 
has sounded out business and labor groups on this --
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I think there's been plenty of public 
discourse on this over the years and even recently, but I don't think 
I want to add to that.
	     
	     Q	  In February, though, the President said that this 
was something to be considered 10 or 15 years down the road.  What 
has happened between then and now to cause this administration to 
change its mind?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I think as we said yesterday, it is 
something that the working groups are looking at.  They're 
considering a wide variety of options on everything from funding to 
specific options that will be covered by the President's health care 
plan.  The President has not taken it up yet, has not made a decision 
on it.  And beyond that, I don't have anything to add.
	     
	     Q	  You haven't answered the question.  It wasn't being 
considered by anyone in the White House after the President's 
comments in February, and George reaffirmed that in a briefing.
	     
	     Q	  And then suddenly --
	     
	     Q	  What happened?

	     MS. MYERS:  The working groups, as we have said 
throughout, we instructed to consider a wide variety of options 
across-the-board.  And one of the things that has been talked about 
and that they are clearly considering is some kind of a value-added 
tax.

	     Q	  But the President himself took this off the table, 
Dee Dee, and suddenly it reappears.  And this goes to the credibility 
of this administration in a way.  What has happened in the meantime?

	     MS. MYERS:  The President has not looked at this, it 
hasn't been presented to him, again, yet.  The working groups are 
looking at it, as they're looking at a wide variety of options, and 
no decisions have been made.

	     Q	  And it raises the question of how independently the 
task force is working.

	     MS. MYERS:  The task force was instructed to consider 
all options, and they've taken that mandate seriously and they're 
considering all options.

	     Q	  But that's not the impression that the President 
left in February.  The impression he left was that this was something 
that was long-range, to be looked at 10, 15 years down the road.  The 
clear implication of his remarks was that this was something that was 
not on the table, not an option. 

	     Q	  "If it changes I'll tell you."
	     
	     Q	  Bring him on.

	     Q	  And you repeatedly referred to the President's 
remarks, telling us that those were still in operation.
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  It's changed, and we told you.  (Laughter.)
	     
	     Q	  But that's what Alice Rivlin's comments and Donna 
Shalala comments were about.  I mean, that seemed like an 
orchestrated effort because you have two independent Cabinet officers 
--

	     MS. MYERS:  I wouldn't -- no, Alice Rivlin's not a 
Cabinet member, first of all.  Second of all, it was not 
orchestrated, but clearly, they both said yesterday and in the last 
couple of days that it's something that's being looked at.  We 
confirmed that yesterday.  And I don't have anything to add to that.

	     Q	  Is it because he has very few options?

	     Q	  Is this something that it will be incumbent upon 
the task force to convince the President about?  In other words, has 
the President himself personally ruled it out and it's now up to the 
task force to convince him to put it back on the table?  Or is it, in 
fact, back on the table, having been placed there by discussions with 
the President?  

	     MS. MYERS:  It is not the working group's mission at 
this point to convince the President of anything.  It is their 
mission to put before him his options and to explain the benefits and 
the costs and the basic pros and cons of each of those options.  I 
think that they will certainly present the VAT to him in that 
context, and at this point he's not -- that presentation has not been 
made, but it's something that he will hear and he has not made a 
decision on.

	     Q	  They will present it to him as one of his options, 
though he specifically ruled it out?

	     MS. MYERS:  Correct.

	     Q	  Dee Dee, is this more than a trial balloon?  Is 
this a serious consideration that the working groups are giving to 
this form of taxation?

	     MS. MYERS:  It's simply a statement of fact.  The 
working groups are considering a wide variety of options on a number 
of issues relating to health care reform.  One of the options that 
they're looking at is the VAT. 

	     Q	  Dee Dee, when the working groups were examining 
this possibility, was this on the table during the same time period 
that you were telling us that it was not?

	     MS. MYERS:  I don't know what the specific timing of 
their drafting of options is.  I don't know.

	     Q	  Who was telling you that it was not under 
consideration?

	     MS. MYERS:  I was referring back to the President's 
comments.

	     Q	  Have they discovered that the sin taxes won't raise 
enough money to fund the core benefit package?

	     MS. MYERS:  No, there's no decisions that have been made 
on how to pay for the health care plan.
	     
	     Q	  I'm asking whether the projections --
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  There's a number of options depending on how 
the plan is structured.  You can't decide how much the plan is going 
to cost until you decide what the plan is going to look like.  And so 
you can't discuss what financing options have been ruled in our out 
until you know.

	     Q	  Dee Dee, we've been told that they have a computer 
models on a number of possible packages.

	     MS. MYERS:  Correct.  

	     Q	  The question is whether they have now determined 
whether sin taxes would not produce enough money for even the barest 
minimum package.  That is not a very difficult computation.

	     MS. MYERS:  It is a question that you know that we're 
not going to answer until -- there's a number of options being 
considered.  It depends on how the package is structured.  The exact 
details of the package and the financing mechanisms used to pay for 
them are all among the decisions that have yet to be made.  
	     
	     Q	  And when the President has been meeting with health 
care -- his health care advisors, which we are told he has been doing 
--
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  Correct.
	     
	     Q	     they have never once said to him, these are your 
funding options, including the VAT?  He has never heard the word VAT 
in his --
	     
	     MS. MYERS:    I am not going to comment on the specific 
nature of the daily -- they're not daily, but the quasi-regular 
briefings.
	     
	     Q	  Well, you have.
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I have not, other than to say that he's not 
considered the VAT.  And I think that is a true statement.
	     
	     Q	  No, but you said that it has not been presented to 
him as an option.
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  Correct.
	     
	     Q	  That doesn't mean he hasn't heard about it.
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I'm not going to get into the details of 
what's discussed.  I think that statement stands for itself.
	     
	     Q	     specific, Dee Dee.  When you say he hasn't 
looked at it, do you mean that he hasn't looked at it in terms of 
paying for medical coverage, or hasn't looked at it in general?  
Because back in Chilicothe he was very specific in defining how it 
works, what the advantages are, the whole thing.  It sounds like --
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  But that was -- I think in Chilicothe, if 
you go back to his remarks there, it was a broader philosophical 
discussion of the tax structure.  And I think the comments were 
generally in reference to the overall economic plan.  But clearly, 
it's something that he's thought about in the broad context.  I mean, 
that was clear in Chilicothe.  What I'm saying is that in the process 
of the working groups it's something that he hasn't considered yet.  
It's something that the working groups will present to him among the 
number of options, and that no decisions have been made.  And I'm not 
going to comment any further on the details of the meetings where 
health care issues are being discussed.
	     
	     Q	  It's your statement from this podium that no 
discussion of this has taken place.  You say that no option -- that 
the option has not been presented to him.
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  That is correct.
	     
	     Q	  Do you stand by -- does the White House still stand 
by George's statement in March that this will not be in the proposal?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  No decisions have been made.  We have 
nothing to add to what's already been said.
	     
	     Q	  Let me follow up here.  Do you stand by what Rivlin 
said yesterday, that if any kind of VAT were to be used or 
considered, that other changes to the tax code would have to be made 
so that it would be less regressive?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I'm not going to comment any further on what 
might happen if.
	     
	     Q	  But do you stand by the previous conversations in 
February that if there were to be a VAT, I think the President said 
you'd exclude food and energy --
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I'm not going to comment on the specific 
structure of a decision that hasn't been made.
	     
	     Q	  Was the President aware prior to Donna Shalala's 
comments yesterday that this was under consideration by the working 
groups?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I don't know specifically what --
	     
	     Q	  Could you check for us, because that's a real 
important credibility question?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  Sure.
	     
	     Q	  Since the task force was brought together this 
issue has been discussed, at the beginning and throughout, as one 
fairly painless way to raise a lot of money.  Were you all kept in 
the dark?  Was the Press Office kept in the dark over the past month 
and a half when you've been denying that a VAT tax would be 
considered that it was actually on the table over there as an option?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I think we've said all that we have to say.  
It is something the working groups are looking at.  The President has 
not made a decision about it yet.  And beyond that, I have nothing to 
add.
	     
	     Q	  Well, sorry, Dee Dee, there are still a couple of 
questions that we are going to have to ask because we have a problem 
with credibility here -- yours primarily.  What we're asking is, if 
you all were not told at all that this thing was being considered 
while you were coming out here and telling us that it was not, or if 
it's a case that you were coming out here and deliberately misleading 
us.
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I don't believe that anyone has ever come 
out here and deliberately misled you from this podium -- ever --ever.
	     
	     Q	  Has anyone tried to shade it a little bit to 
indicate something -- has anybody told anybody to come out --
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  We're not trying to shade answers or 
deliberately mislead anybody.  I've said what I have to say about 
this issue.
	     
	     Q	  All we were trying to find out --
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I understand what you're trying to find out 
and I've given you the answers, Helen.
	     
	     Q	  We're trying to find out what changed -- what made 
it an option again.  That's the --
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  The working groups were given a broad 
mandate to investigate all options, and they are doing that.  
	     
	     Q	  Yes, but it wasn't an option before.  How can you 
investigate it if the President has taken it off the table?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  It is something that they're obviously 
considering and the President has not made a decision on.
	     
	     Q	  Yes, but he took it off the table in February.
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  Working groups are considering it.  They'll 
present it to the President at some point and he'll make a decision.
	     
	     Q	  Why would they consider it if he has taken it off 
the table?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  It's clearly on the table. 
	     
	     Q	  Yes, but he took it off the table.  Did he change 
his mind?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  It's back on the table, Bill.
	     
	     Q	  Did he change his mind?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  He said this morning that he hasn't made a 
decision about it.  He obviously knows that it's on the table.  It's 
something that he will look at at some and when we have a decision on 
this we'll let you know.
	     
	     Q	  So he must have changed his mind, right?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  At some point it will be looked at.  I mean, 
--
	     
	     Q	  Dee Dee, there's like two options -- either he 
changed his mind or the working groups think they're authority 
exceeds the President's.
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  The working groups were given a broad 
mandate to look at all options; they've done that.
	     
	     Q	  Are you going to put out his income tax?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  Yes, there will be something available on 
his income tax probably later this afternoon.  His return will be 
available. 
	     
	     Q	  Will there be any kind of briefing to go through 
it?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  No, nothing's planned.  I think someone will 
be available, probably not in a briefing setting, but to walk you 
through the questions.
	     
	     Q	  We're used to be walked line-by-line through the 
presidential tax forms.
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I've seen those briefings.  (Laughter.)
	     
	     Q	  Could we have one?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:   No, I don't think there will be any kind of 
a formal briefing, but there will be somebody available to answer 
your questions about it.
	     
	     Q	  Did they file a joint form?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  Yes.
	     
	     Q	  When did he file it?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I believe it's being filed today.
	     
	     Q	  Dee Dee, is there going to be a backgrounder for 
Miyazawa?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  No, there will be a readout after the 
meeting.
	     
	     Q	  No backgrounder today?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  No backgrounder today.
	     
	     Q	  This is complicated stuff.  We need help.  
(Laughter.)
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  We can't give you taxes and Miyazawa all in 
one day, it's too confusing.  (Laughter.)
	     
	     Q	  Vance and Owen have opened the doors on the use of 
force in Bosnia.   They've both said that, A, they never ruled it 
out, and B, it might be necessary now.  Does that influence your 
thinking on whether or not to change your approach?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  There's been no change in our policy towards 
Bosnia.  We have always said that we'd consider --
	     
	     Q	  But does that impact upon your decision?  Are they 
people whose opinions would carry weight with you?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  They're people whose opinions carry weight 
certainly.  I mean, the President supports the process that they've 
initiated.  But there's been no change in our policy for Bosnia, 
although we're considering a number of options right now.  If the 
Serbs don't come back to the negotiating table, if they don't sign on 
to some kind of an agreement, we will consider additional options, 
which we've been saying regularly.
	     
	     Q	  One follow-up question then?  We cannot get a 
straight answer from anyone in the administration.  Why do you not 
set a deadline for the Serbs?  Can you tell us the strategic or 
tactical reasons for not giving them a deadline to come to the table?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  We're continuing to put pressure on them 
every day.
	     
	     Q	  Which doesn't work so --
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  Well, we think it is having some effect.  
We're going to continue to tighten sanctions.  As you know, we 
support the omnibus resolution.  We expect that to come to a vote on 
the 26th.  
	     
	     Q	  You say it's having an effect -- can you give us 
any documentation?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I'd be happy to provide somebody to talk to 
you about the impact of the sanctions and things like that.
	     
	     Q	  There's been no -- you have not been able to 
provide anybody who can tell us that the sanctions have had any 
effect in Bosnia.  Serbia, yes; in Bosnia, no.
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I think that they've had effect in Serbia 
and we think they've had some effect in Bosnia.  And again, I'll be 
happy to provide somebody to walk you through the details of that, if 
you'd like.
	     
	     Q	  We would like to hear from someone who can show us 
what the effect has been in Bosnia.  We had the briefing on all of 
the terrible things that are happening in Belgrade, but we haven't 
seen anything that indicates an impact on the fighting.  Can you 
provide something along those lines?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I will see what I can get you.
	     
	     Q	  On the extra Russian aid that Christopher announced 
this morning -- where is that money coming from?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  We'll have to work with Congress on the 
details of that package.
	     
	     Q	  So that would be new money that you would hope to 
get?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:    Yes, that's new money, in addition to the 
$1.6 billion announced in Vancouver.  So I assume that you all have 
seen the $1.8-billion package that was announced this morning in 
Tokyo by Secretary Christopher.
	     
	     Q	  Isn't there a concern, though, about offering 
something which you have to get in Congress?  I mean, that was the 
concern with Vancouver; you didn't want to do that.
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  The concern with Vancouver was to do 
something immediately, which required money that was already approved 
in the Fiscal '93 budget.  What we're looking at now is a little bit 
longer-term plan to build on top of the $1.6 billion that we 
announced in Vancouver.  This clearly will require congressional 
approval, or some of it will anyway, and we're going to continue to 
work with Congress to make that happen.
	     
	     Q	  To what extent has that been vetted or agreed to by 
Congress?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  The President has had a number of 
conversations with members and will continue to work with them as 
this process moves forward.
	     
	     Q	  Was Christopher able to put this package out with a 
fair degree of understanding that you will be able to get it through 
Congress?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  It was created in consultation with 
Congress.
	     
	     Q	  In meeting with the law enforcement officials, is 
that -- does that have a set speech and a goal?  A direction?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  Yes, the President will talk about -- and 
the law enforcement organizations are endorsing the President's jobs 
package.  They believe particularly the summer jobs package will help 
give kids something to do.
	     
	     Q	  Who are they?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  It's members or leadership from three 
organizations:  NAPO, which is the National Association of Police 
Organizations; IBPO, which is the International Brotherhood of Police 
Organizations, I believe; and IUPA, which is the International Union 
of Police Associations.
	     
	     Q	  Will the FBI chief be there?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  The FBI chief?  No.
	     
	     Q	  Or any other federal law enforcement officials?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  No, it will be the President and these 
national law enforcement organization leaders.
	     
	     Q	  Does the $1.8 billion announced today include the 
$400 million that's in the FY '94 budget for disarmament?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  No.  The Nunn-Lugar money is separate.
	     
	     Q	  So this would be the $700 million that's in the 
budget already, plus another $1.1 billion?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I believe all of this is on top of the $700 
million already in the budget.
	     
	     Q	  Is this going to be part of the supplemental or 
Fiscal '94 --
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  We'll work with Congress on the exact 
funding mechanism -- on exactly how this will be paid for.
	     
	     Q	  This $1.8 billion on top of --
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  On top of $700 million -- on top of the $400 
million Nunn-Lugar money we announced earlier.
	     
	     Q	  And this is what prompted the President to call Bob 
Dole -- it was on this tranche, not on the previous money he was 
calling Bob Dole?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  Correct.
	     
	     Q	  Is there a briefing on Miyazawa?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  There will be a readout after the meeting 
with Miyazawa.  Tomorrow.
	     
	     Q	  Dee Dee, on a totally unrelated matter, some 
Republicans who are active in the U.S. Chamber of Commerce are 
complaining about this new cozy relationship between the White House 
and the Chamber of Commerce.  There are -- the town hall meeting the 
other night, the satellite and all of this relationship.
Does the White House feel that you're getting too close to these 
Chambers of Commerce?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  That's an interesting charge.  (Laughter.)  
After how many years of Democrats being accused of not paying any 
attention to the Chambers, now there are those who would accuse us of 
being too close.  I think that's interesting.  But no, we're thrilled 
by the support we've received from the national Chamber and local 
Chambers across the country and we'll continue to work with them on 
this and other initiatives.
	     
	     Q	  What's the status of the President thinking about 
going to this Democratic retreat?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  It's on his calendar.  I think he'll almost 
certainly go.
	     
	     Q	  All three days?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  We haven't figured out exactly when he'll be 
there yet.  
	     
	     Q	  Is it open to coverage?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  No, I believe the whole thing is closed.
	     
	     Q	  Is he going to have any kind of address, statement, 
anything at all on the gay rights march on the 25th?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  We're still looking at that.  We haven't 
made a final decision about how we'll -- who will make a statement or 
what --
	     
	     Q	  Any meetings scheduled with any of the leaders?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  Nothing is scheduled, but I wouldn't rule it 
out.
	     
	     Q	  What about an AIDS czar?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  It's coming.
	     
	     Q	  Anything on the weekend?
	     
	     Q	  There's been a suggestion that he's going to this 
retreat to avoid having to participate in the gay rights -- or appear 
or have any involvement in the gay rights march.
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  No, I think this is something he's been 
discussing for a long time -- appearing at the Senate Democratic 
retreat.
	     
	     Q	  The weekend?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  Weekend?  Don't know -- the only thing on 
right now is the radio address on Saturday.
	     
	     Q	  Any travel plans?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  If it changes -- none right now.
	     
	     Q	  He's not going to be off campaigning for his 
stimulus package?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  No specific plans right now.
	     
	     Q	  What about mid-week?  Anything likely?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  It's possible.  Yes, I think it's likely 
that we'll travel next week -- certainly the weekend.
	     
	     Q	  Has he called Thurmond about his daughter?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I don't know.  I'll check.
	     
	     Q	  Going to name a drug czar this weekend?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  This weekend?  I don't believe so.
	     
	     Q	  And the radio address on Saturday -- is that going 
to be focused on the stimulus package?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I'm sure it will.

That is an idea.. The most efficient moon habitat.. 

also the idea of how to get the people off the moon once the prize was won..

Also the idea of how to rescue someone who is "dying" on the moon.

Maybe have a area where they can all "see" each other, and can help each other
if something happens.. 

I liek the idea of one prize for the first moon landing and return, by a
non-governmental body..

Also the idea of then having a moon habitat race.. 

I know we need to do somthing to get people involved..

Eccentric millionaire/billionaire would be nice.. We see how old Ross feels
about it.. After all it would be a great promotional thing and a way to show he
does care about commericalization and the people.. Will try to broach the
subject to him.. 

Moonbase on the cheap is a good idea.. NASA and friends seem to take to much
time and give us to expensive stuff that of late does not work (hubble and
such). Basically what is the difference between a $1mil peice of junk and a
multi $1mil piece of junk.. I know junk..

I like option C of the new space station design.. 
It needs some work, but it is simple and elegant..

Its about time someone got into simple construction versus overly complex...

From what I understand about radar dectectors all they are is a passive
device much like the radio in your car.  They work as an antenna picking
up that radar signals that the radar gun sends out.  Therefore there would
be no way of detecting a radar detector any more than there would be of
detecting whether some one had a radio in their car.

Actually, Hiten wasn't originally intended to go into lunar orbit at all,
so it indeed didn't have much fuel on hand.  The lunar-orbit mission was
an afterthought, after Hagoromo (a tiny subsatellite deployed by Hiten
during a lunar flyby) had a transmitter failure and its proper insertion
into lunar orbit couldn't be positively confirmed.

It should be noted that the technique does have disadvantages.  It takes
a long time, and you end up with a relatively inconvenient lunar orbit.
If you want something useful like a low circular polar orbit, you do have
to plan to expend a certain amount of fuel, although it is reduced from
what you'd need for the brute-force approach.

In order of your questions, I oppose it, I oppose it, I oppose it and
(Huh?  Wha?  Where did _that_ topic come from and what's it got to do
with the discussion at hand? :-)

When I was discussing the concept of different criminal laws for crimes
against different classes of people (and yes, I do consider laws which
allow/mandate enhanced penalties following conviction based upon the
convict's attitudes towards the class membership of the victim to fit
into that category), the category of classes I had in mind was that of
the standard civil rights discussion -- classes based upon race, gender,
ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, etc.  Having you ask about
classes based upon one's _profession_ rather than one's personal
characteristics caught me off guard, and I had to think out the question
from scratch.

What I finally decided was that the law should not recognize such
classes because to do so would be to formally and officially declare
some people to be of more worth than others, and that would be anathema
to the underlying American concept of equal treatment under the law.

Last year, when a federal crime bill was under consideration which would
have expanded the federal death penalty to an additional fifty-plus
crimes, including the murder of various federal officers hitherto not
protected by that "aura of deterrence," critics pointed out the
absurdity of having laws which made the death penalty available for the
murder of a federal postal inspector but not for ther murder of a
civilian teacher, when the latter [arguably] provided a much more
valueable service and therefore would be the greater loss to society.
This was an emotionally compelling argument, but even the proponents of
that viewpoint appeared to tacitly assume that the state should judge
some lives as being more valuable than others on the basis of their
"contribution to society."  I view that doctrine as being both (a)
personally repugnant and (b) repugnant to the Equal Protection clause of
the 14th Amendment.

Accordingly, I believe that there should be no laws which give any
profession-based class of people special protection (via the mechanism
of supplying stronger statutory deterrence of crimes against members of
that class), not even police officers, federal officers or high-ranking
members of the Executive Branch of the federal government.

    You're being too generous to the communists, I think.  In practice,
communism has "solved" the problem by killing off anybody who is _too_
productive, and who therefore raises embarrassing questions about why the
rest of the group is a bunch of sluggards.  The mass butchery of "kulaks"
in the USSR is a good instance of this.
    A poor second best is to have a neighboring capitalist country to which
people of politically incorrect skill and ambition flee.  I often wonder
just what Castro would have done if the Cubans presently in Miami would
have been forced to remain in Cuba.  Would they have revolted and killed
him off, or been killed?
    Best of all is to build a wall locking the citizens of your country in,
load it up so heavily with attack dogs, barbed wire, and land mines that
most people fleeing over it die, and then give everyone the choice of
obedience, prison, or flight.  This would be a bad science-fiction novel,
if the East Germans hadn't actually done it.  The last person to die
crossing the wall, as I recall, was an unarmed woman who was shot in the
back.  Erich Honecker was going to go on trial for that, but he fled to
socialists in Chile.
    It's good to be kind to one's intellectual opponents, but sometimes
it's a sheer waste of time.

Top Ten Ways Slick Willie Could Improve His Standing With Americans



10. Institute a national sales tax to pay for the socialization of
    America's health care resources.

9.  Declare war on Serbia. Reenact the draft.

8.  Stimulate the economy with massive income transfers to Democtratic
    constituencies.

7.  Appoint an unrepetent socialist like Mario Cuomo to the Suprmeme Court.

6.  Focus like a laser beam on gays in the military.

5.  Put Hillary in charge of the Ministry of Truth and move Stephanopoulos
    over to socialzed health care.

4.  Balance the budget through confiscatory taxation.

3.  Remind everyone, again, how despite the Democrats holding the
    Presidency, the majority of seats in the House, and in the Senate,
    the Republicans have still managed to block his tax-and-spend programs.

2.  Go back to England and get a refresher course in European Socialism.

1.  Resign, now!

	Low power quartz oscillators are usually 32 kHz (and THESE
have significant temperature drifts, which one doesn't often notice
while wearing the watch on one's wrist).  Low temperature sensitivity
is available in other crystal types, which unfortunately
are larger and higher frequency (1 MHz or so) and take more
battery power.  

	Programmable timers might be less accurate, but they
are more power-stingy than suitable crystal oscillators.

	Tonigth a TV journal here in Brasil announced that an object,
beyond Pluto's orbit, was found by an observatory at Hawaii. They
named the object Karla.

	The program said the object wasn't a gaseous giant planet, and
should be composed by rocks and ices.

	Can someone confirm these information? Could this object be a
new planet or a Kuiper object?

	Thanks in advance.

I've got the same problem; I can't dig up any info on the jumper settings
on the hd 3.5" drives.

Can anyone recommend a reference book(s) on the subject, rather than a
"quick fix" type answer??  I was going to start hooking up things and
logging the results, but the prospect of a ten second smoke test deters
me...

Thanks, Kirk Cowen.

	Take a second look at "non-toxic, non-flammable":

		MACE (sold tothe public) is supposedly nontoxic.
		Whatthey do not tell you is that if you get mace directly
		on the linings of the lungs (such as a direct snort to
		the face) above certain quantities, it reacts similarly
		to a mustard gas inhalation.

			I know:  my father and grandfather were exposed
			to poison gas in WWI and WWII; Dad went through
			the side effects of any WEAPON, including those
			"non-toxic" aerosols.

		WHat the label ACTUALLY means is ::

			usually, it wont kill you
			it may give you permanent CSS asthsma
			but that's better than blowing a hole in your
				head ...

		ALL aerosols are flammable IF YOU HAVE ENOUGH OXYGEN
		AND HIT IT WITH THE RIGHT IGNITER.  SOme of the most
		non-flammable substances known will BOOM or SEARFLAME
		if you hit it with the right combo.


		Let's take one:  a trash can fire.  Makes black smoke;
		already burned right?  Can't go boom, right?  Wrong.

		Suck that smoke (made up of paper that has carbonized,
		or burned about 35% of the fuel in it) into an air
		conditioning return, mix with about 5:1 air, and light
		a match.  200 feet of conduit is about the same, when
		filled with that smoke mixture, as oh, say 200 pounds TNT

			THAT is why the fire codes say NO OPEN CEILING
			TILES IN BUILDINGS.  Because 3-5 stories of
			a building have blown OUT by "nonflammable _smoke_"

	So:
		Take a little "nonflammable aerosol"
		Mix with gasoline or kerosene fumes

			NO electricity, remeber?  A bit of heating
			on the WACO plains?  Boil water to drink
			since the water was cut off?

		liberally mix and allow to settle for 1-4 hours

		Fumes vent down into the bus underground, and the Davidians
		move the children UPSTAIRS to a saferoom (they had one,
		armor plated, remember?) to BREATH, because kids get sick
		and die from tear gas.

		and along comes a tracer, a spark, what have you:

			everyone burns to death.

Try thinking before opening mouth: it may not have happened the
way the Gmen say it did.

Gee, I got the idea from somewhere that devices like this were in common
use in WWII, so that commanders on board ships could bellow at the troops
landing on a beach, for example.

Which reminds me of an anecdote from the mid-60s.  At a communications
conference a Marine Corps communications officer said he didn't care
much for all the spread-spectrum multi-access expensive communication
systems that people were talking about at the time; what he wanted
was a kilowatt broadcast transmitter on the ship and a $4.95 Japanese
transistor radio stuck in the ear of every Marine hitting the beach.

Ya, Fat Chance.  The "offending" rider was a moto journalist.  Those
guys can sell hundreds of bikes with one stroke of the pen and
as such get away with murder when it comes to test bikes.

One way or the other, it was probably worth the early expiration of 
one mufler to see a bone head get his butt baked.

From what I know, protection is necessary, esp. if you plan to route
the cables into an unknown environment (out of your control). Things
like accidental shorts between the signal lines and power cables, or
even lightning strikes are very likely and I don't think you like to see
the sight of your computer going up in smoke! [Even ethernet cards are
protected. I've looked at the one in my PC and the connector is
protected by a gas discharge tube!]

{But if you plan to use the serial cables for internal routings (i.e. in
controlled environments), it should be reasonably safe not to have
them.}

Suggestion: look in the RS data book. They have several RS232
transceivers that have overvoltage protection. Among them include the
LT1080, LT1081 and MAX250 and MAX251. The Maxims are suppose to be
electrically isolated ones but still need opto-isolators to work (don't
ask me why. I've never used them before.

Another alternative is an RS232 surge protector. Two are listed in the
RS catalogue. If you need additional info (i.e. stock nos.), just e-mail
me.

That is because two creation stories is one of the worst examples of 
a difficulty with the Bible.  "were formed" can also be translated "had been
formed" in chapter two without any problems.  So the text does not demand
that there are two creation stories.

   This I gotta see some authority for.

from Black's Law Dictionary, Revised 4th Ed., page 1473:

RESIDENCE.  A factual place of abode.  Living in a particular
locality.  Reese v. Reese, 179 Misc. 665, 40 N.Y.S.2d 468, 472;
Zimmerman, 175 Or. 585, 155 P.2d 293, 295.  It requires only bodily
presence as an inhabitant of a place.  In re Campbell's Guardianship,
216 Minn. 113, 11 N.W.2d 786, 789.

     As ``domicile'' and ``residence'' are usually in the same place,
they are frequently used as if they had the same meaning, but they are
not identical terms, for a person may have two places of residence, as
in the city and country, but only one domicile.  Residence means
living in a particular locality, but domicile means living in that
locality with intent to make it a fixed and permanent home.  Residence
simply requires bodily presence as an inhabitant in a given place,
while domicile requires bodily presence in that place and also an
intention to make it one's domicile.  In re Riley's Will, 266 N.Y.S.
209, 148 Misc. 588.  ``Residence'' demands less intimate local ties
than ``domicile,'' but ``domicile'' allows absence for indefinite
period if intent to return remains.  Immigration Act 1917, sec. 3, 8
U.S.C.A. sec. 136 (e, p).  Transatlantica Italiana v. Elting,
C.C.A.N.Y., 74 F.2d 732, 733.  But see, Ward v. Ward, 115, W.Va 429,
176 S.E. 708, 709; Southwestern Greyhound Lines v. Craig, 182 Okl.
610, 80 P 2d 221, 224; holding that residence and domicile are
synonymous terms.  ``Residence'' has a meaning dependent on context
and purpose of statute.  In re Jones, 341 Pa. 329, 19 A.2d 280, 282.
Words ``residence'' and ``domicile'' may have an identical or variable
meaning depending on subject-matter and context of statute.  Kemp v.
Kemp, 16 N.Y.S.2d 26, 34, 172 Misc. 738.

     Legal residence.  See Legal.

RESIDENT.  One who has his residence in a place.  See Residence.

     Also a tenant, who was obliged to reside on his lord's land, and
not to depart from the same; called, also, ``homme levant et
couchant,'' and in Normandy, ``resseant du fief.''

       I've read about more than a few of these programs that ran into
problems in convincing parents to get their children immunized even
when they were delivered to their doorstep.  (I don't know, maybe
that sheet they have to be informed of about possible risks, side-
effects, and bad reactions scares them.)

And I recommend the movie _The Thin Blue Line_, which is about the
same case.  Not as much legal detail, but still an excellent film.  It
shows how very easy it is to come up with seemingly conclusive
evidence against someone whom you think is guilty.

I had the good luck to obtain an EICO dynamic conductance 
tube tester for a song. Unfortunately, I was a little out of
key; the only thing wrong with it was an open meter movement.
Does anyone know where I can find either another meter movement
like it, a dead-but-not-the-meter-dead unit, or schematics 
to specify the current scale of the meter movement? I can cut
and paste a more sensitive movement in if I can find what the
full scale current was. Or... is EICO still contactable?

The thing is a model 666 -nope, not a joke or any sort of snide
reference.

If you sent them a letter asking for them, you might get them.  Here's
my guess of how part of a session might look:

Answer: No
Questions: Do you disapprove due to the gays in the military issue?

Conclusion: Clinton has a low approval rating because he's not moving
fast enough on gays in the military.

Gong!

Take a moment and look at what you just wrote. First you defined
an "objective" morality and then you qualified this "objective" morality
with subjective justifications. Do you see the error in this?

Sorry, you have just disqualified yourself, but please play again.

Please!  I'm begging you!  Quit confusing religious groups, and stop
making generalizations!  I'm a Protestant!  I'm an evangelical!  I don't
believe that my way is the only way!  I'm not a "creation scientist"!  I
don't think that homosexuals should be hung by their toenails!  

If you want to discuss bible thumpers, you would be better off singling
out (and making obtuse generalizations about) Fundamentalists.  If you
compared the actions of Presbyterians or Methodists with those of Southern 
Baptists, you would think that they were different religions!

Please, prejudice is about thinking that all people of a group are the
same, so please don't write off all Protestants or all evangelicals!

Mein Kampf and Limbaugh's transcribed rant, The Way Things Ought to 
Be before Sahl issued his comparative review. As usual, Sahl's was 
independent and sharp as a scalpel.
	My effort can only dream of comparing favorably to Mort's. At 
least it has a fairly popular orginating premise; everyone I'd mention the 
idea to thought it was either divinely inspired or at least past due for 
delivery.
	Those reactions are based on parallels that should be obvious to the 
most peripheral observer of the Acts of those False Prophets. Both are 
noted for their galvanizing oratorical skills, which they both used with 
passion to generate a political cult of massive numerical proportions (in 
fact, Limbaugh claims to have an audience of just over 12 million, almost 
identical to the number of votes cast for Hitler in the April 1932 German 
election). Both used a myopic social perspective to build the cult, and 
enthusiastically amputated facts from the record to fabricate their 
ideological quilt.
	The last point is glaringly documented by passages in the opening 
pages of both books. Hitler's example is when, on page 5, he claims the 
German nationalist terrorist Leo Schlageter (he bombed part of a railway 
line between Dusseldorf and Duisburg, being caught in the act, in 1923) 
was "betrayed to France by a representative of his government" when 
there has never been any factual foundation for such a statement.
	In fact, the governments of both the Reich and Prussia, as well as 
the Vatican, actively intervened to save him from execution, and almost 
succeeded. Limbaugh follows suit by making the hysterically sarcastic 
claim in his introduction that "in a school or during a commencement 
ceremony or many other public places... God is unconstitutional." Of 
course, it's not God but the official imposition of particular concepts of 
God against an individual's will that's unconstitutional. But Limbaugh is 
too gleeful in his talent for distortion to want you to know that.
	Of course, one would assume that, by comparing the two books, 
my main point would be that The Way Things Ought to Be is the modern 
American Mein Kampf. Not really. At the time of the first German version 
of Mein Kampf, Hitler was just four months out of prison (June, 1925), 
and trying to reorganize the Nazis. He used the book to build his dozen 
million followers. Limbaugh, on the other hand, came up with his book 
after building his dozen million. Twelve million went a longer way in 
Weimar Germany that it does in the Republicrat United States.
	Thus, the more accurate parallels would be that Limbaugh's daily 
three-hour radio show is the American Mein Kampf, the primary 
propoganda tool used to pump up the angry volume; and that The Way 
Things Ought to Be is actually the American Triumph of the Will, a 
translation of the same fascist message into a different medium. Also, the 
printed word was the more important medium in Weimar Germany, since 
radio was still being thought of by impoverished Germans as a medium of 
luxury in 1925. Today, on the other hand, Americans are more likely to 
spend a few seconds to tune a radio dial at no monetary charge than drop 
$22 for 304 pages of transcripts of the same words.
	But, as Mort Sahl also observed on the radio the other night, some 
cloutmeister of the radical right wants Limbaugh to be a focal point of 
their propoganda. (And remember, Sahl is an Al Haig conservative these 
days.)
	Mort might not know exactly who Rush's equivalent of Rodolf 
Hess is (the book itself suggests Ed McLaughlin, the former president of 
ABC radio and now Limbaugh's partner in EFM Media, the radio 
program's production company). But Mort himself is a veteran of the talk 
show, having hosted them in New York, Washington and Los Angeles. He 
knows what evil lurks in the hearts of major market media men. He knows 
that Limbaugh could not have collected his audience had not the 
opportunity been placed on a silver platter and handed to him. Limbaugh 
earns his money just as honestly as Al Capone did; it's almost worthy of a 
RICO indictment.
	On questions of social issues, there is an overabundance of 
material in the Limbaugh book that seems to echo Hitler's venom. For 
example:

On Their Own Qualifications to Control Society
	Hitler: "Out of the host of sometimes millions of people, who 
individually more or less clearly and distinctly guess the truth, partly 
perhaps understand it, one man [author's emphasis] must step forward in 
order to form, with apodeictic force, out of the wavering world of 
imagination of the great masses, granite principles, and to take up the fight 
for their sole correctness, until out of the playing waves of a free world of 
thought a brazen rock of uniform combination of form and will arises" 
(page 577).
	Limbaugh: "Who needs the media when they've got me? ... The 
show is devoted exclusively to what I think ... [the phrase "with half my 
brain tied behind my back to make it even"] denotes the egress of mental 
aptitude I require to engage and demolish liberals and others who disagree 
with me ... It might take four or five years, but I'm convinced The Media 
will slowly and reluctantly come around to my way of thinking, kicking 
and screaming all the way." (pages 266, 21, 299 and 273, respectively.)

On Religion as the Basis of a Nation
	Hitler: "In this world human culture and civilization are 
inseperably bound up with the existence of the Aryan. His dying-off or his 
decline would again lower upon this earth the dark veils of a time without 
culture ... He who dares to lay hand upon the highest image of the Lord 
sins against the benevolent Creator of this miracle and helps in the 
expulsion from Paradise." (Page 581.)
	Limbaugh: "America was founded as a Judeo-Christian country ... 
But our intellectual and political elites are often either hostile or 
ambivalent toward religion ... People for whom belief in God is at best a 
charming superstition have managed to ban prayer from the public schools 
for the last thirty years. Is it only a coincidence that the quality of 
American education has declined ever since?" (pages 274-5.)

On Popular Culture as a Reason for Social Collapse
	Hitler: "The fight against the poisoning of the soul has to set in ... 
One has only to look at the menus of our movie houses, vaudevilles and 
theatres; and one can hardly deny that this is not the right kind of food ... 
Theatre, art, literature, movies, the press, billposters and window displays 
must be cleaned of the symptoms of a rotting world and put into the 
service of a moral idea of State and culture." (pages 346 and 348.)
	Limbaugh: "Today, Hollywood is in trouble. The reason [is] that 
Hollywood has forgotten who its audience is ... They make fun of people 
who believe in God. They ridicule the traditional family, heterosexuality 
and monagamy. They disparage American heroes." (page 254.)

On the News Meida
	Hitler: "The activity of the so-called liberal press was the work of 
gravediggers for the German people and the German Reich. One can pass 
by in silence the Marxist papers of lies ... it's task is only to break the 
people's folkish and national spine, in order to make it ripe for the yoke of 
slavery of international capital and its masters, the Jews." (Page 331.)
	Limbaugh: "Elements of The Media have jumped on the 
bandwagon of leftist causes. The cynical journalist of the past has been 
replaced in many cases by an enthusiastic cheerleader for causes ... During 
the Gulf war, CNN correspondent Bernard Shaw [said] CNN is a global 
network. We can't take sides. Cant take sides? --- --- ---! ... If they don't 
realize that their freedom lies in the United States of America and that 
therefore they should defend this nation, they are hopelessly misguided 
and, may I suggest, flirting with megalomania." (pages 270 and 268.)

*     *     *
	
To continue these comparative excerpts is certainly possible, but 
ultimately too depressing to take in one reading.
	After putting these books down, there is one undeniable fact that 
haunts me. In the 1920s, Adolf Hitler fed depressed and frightened 
Germans the opiate of hatred of those around them; in turn, it allowed 
Germans to hand their collective national power to the Nazis. In the 1990s, 
Rush Limbaugh is doing the very same thing: distributing hatred to 
depressed and frightened Americans; in turn, it is helping the American 
radical right to maintain its power base as the 12-year nightmare of the 
Reagan-Bush era comes to an end, hoping to rebuild it into their hopes for 
The Fascist States of America.
	And if Limbaugh is not as repellant a Hitler, it is only because the 
radical right utilizes Limbaugh as its own gateway opiate. One can only 
wonder what the ultimate drug is they plan to hook America on.

just a suggestion:
take a motorola mc14536B set it up to give you a pulse once every sec or ten
secs with either a RC or xtal clock input. then feed to a MC14521B as clock
input and decode output for 1,209,600 sec output ,might have to add a few 'and'
gates or decoder chips to get output and reset pulse back to the'521 to restart
cycle... Trigger a oneshot from the decoded riseing edge ;the one shot then
goes to a mosfet to drive the mechanism to fire the pellet launcher..
these ckts require uAmps of current,between 5 - 15 volts, so a 12 volt
gel cell of a few Amphours would last the six weeks.
Then take the ckt board & battery wrap in 3" or 4" of foam or build a box
of out of the stuff...with plywood or metal exterior...
build a small heater out of 10-50 Watt resistors in series to keep the battery
and ckts warm.
2nd thought use 2 batteries one for heater one for timer and pellet trigger.

Insolate-insolate.......even though the chips state that the - AL
rated devices are good to -55 C.. The batteries have a considerable reduction
in capacity...oh make sure the area inside has minium air leakage..

hope this helps

A brief political/cultural item.

Radio station WGMS in Washington is a classical music station with
a large audience among high officials (elected and otherwise).  
Imagine a radio station that advertises Mercedes Benzes, diamond
jewelry, expensive resorts and (truthfully) Trident submarines.

This morning I heard a commercial for the space station project.
Didn't catch the advertiser.

Guess they're pulling out all the stops.

Well, they claim they are the only radio broadcaster with this
information.  But the city's cable channel (35 in CableVision areas)
shows this information map during travel times (6-9am and 4-7pm, I
believe).  Most of the major LA freeways are covered.  The
computer-generated map shows green, yellow, red, or flashing red
(respectively: <40mph, 25-40mph, >25mph, and "incident"--I might be off
a little on the speeds, since this is from memory).

I often look at this display in the morning to see if I really want to
fight the traffic on the Sepulveda Pass or work from home for a little
while to wait for it to clear.

Another poster explained the origin of the information: sensors (embedded
wire loops) in the pavement near ramps and every half mile or so.  CalTrans
has had a "big board" driven from this data in their traffic control center
for some time.  I don't know if they are selling the data or if anyone
with the equipment necessary for its transmission and display can have
it.

It depends on how badly you want to live.  The FAA says "eight hours, bottle

a blood/alcohol level of 0.4 as legally drunk, I think, which is more than
twice as strict as DWI minimums.

BTW, alcohol metabolizes in your blood at a fixed rate -- one beer/hour will

In the April edition of "One Small Step for a Space Activist",
Allen Sherzer & Tim Kyger write:
  "Another problem is what are called 'wraps' (or sometimes
   the 'center tax'). When work for a large program like
   Freedom or Shuttle is performed at a NASA center, the
   center skims off a portion which goes into what amounts
   to a slush fund. This money is used to fund work the
   center manager wants to fund. This sum is estimated to
   be over a third of the funds allocated. Think about
   that: Of the $30 billion cost of Freedom, fully $10
   billion won't be spent on anything having anything
   to do with Space Stations! Now, maybe that $10 billion
   was wisely spent (and maybe it wasn't), but the work done
   with it should stand on its own merits, not distorting
   the cost of other projects. Congress has no idea of the
   existense of these wraps; Congress has never heard the
   term 'center tax'. They look at the Station they are
   getting and the price they are paying and note that
   it doesn't add up. They wonder this blissfully unaware
   that a third of the money is going for something else."

My dear friends, your mixing fact and fiction here. A couple
of weeks ago, when I first read this in your posting, I
talked with one of the cost experts here in Space Station
at Headquarters [if you wondering why I didn't post a
response immediately, I do have a real job I'm supposed
to be doing here at Headquarters, & digging up old 20 kHz
data & looking into Sherzer/Kyger claims rates pretty low
on the totem pole of priority. Also, I spent last weekend
in Kansas City, at the National Science Teachers 
Association conference, extolling the virtues of SSF
to 15,000 science teachers.]

First off, yes, the concept of 'center tax', or 'wrap' does
exist. If I recall the numbers correctly, the total 'tax'
for the SSF program for this fiscal year is around $40 Million.
This was computed by adding up the WP-1, WP-2, and WP-4
center 'taxes'. With the SSF budget for this fiscal year at
$2.2 Billion, my calculater says the tax percentage is
04/2.2 = 1.8%

Over the life of the SSF program, using your figure of $30
billion for the cost of SSF, a tax at a 1.8% rate comes to
$540 million. This is alot less than $10 billion, but I
will concede it's still an appreciable amount of pocket
change.

I should note that your estimate of the tax rate at 1/3 could
be close to the actual rate. The tax is only charged on funds
that are spent at the center (kind of like McDonalds at some
states, where you do have to pay sales tax if you eat
the food at the restaurant, but you don't if you get it
take-out). For example, at WP-4, the vast bulk of the funds
we receive go to the Rocketdyne Contract, and are *NOT*
subject to the center tax (I don't have the numbers in
front of me, but I'd guess at least 95% of the WP-4 funds
go to Rocketdyne). So, you could be right about a tax
rate of 1/3, but it's only applied to funds spent at the
center, and not to the prime contracts.

This leads to the obvious question "What is the government
doing with SSF funds that don't go to the prime contractors?
(i.e. ok, WP-4 gets a slice of the $30 billion pie. A
big portion of this slice goes to Rocketdyne. What happens
to the balance of the funds, which aren't eaten
up by the center tax?)"

At WP-4, we call these funds we spend in-house supporting
development funds (as they are supporting the development
work done by Rocketdyne). We have used these funds to
setup our own testbed, to checkout the electrical
power system architecture. Our testbed has a real life
solar array field (left over from solar cell research
research a few years back), with lead-acid car batteries
(to simulate the Nickel-Hydrogen batteries on SSF), DC
switchgear, DC-DC converter units, and simulated
loads. Data from the testbed was used in a recent
change evaluation involving concerns about the stability
of the power system.

We have also used the supporting development money to
purchase Nickel Hydrogen batteries, which are on life
testing at both Lewis and the Crane Naval facility in
Indiana. As a side point, 6 of the battery cells on
test recently hit the four year life test milestone.
38 cells have completed 18,552 to 23,405 cycles (the
on-orbit batteries go through 5,840 cycles per year).

As a final example, my 'home' division at Lewis used
the supporting development funds to purchase personal
computers and work stations, for performing system
analyses (like modeling of the performance of the
electrical power system, availability calculations
using a Monte-Carlo simulation, setting up a 
database with information on weight of the power
system elements).

Finally, the money raised by the 'tax' does not all
go into a 'slush fund.' At Lewis, the director
does control a small discretionary fund. Each year,
any individual at Lewis can submit a proposal to
the director to get money from this fund to look
at pretty much anything within the Lewis Charter.

Most of the tax, however, goes to fund the 'general'
services at the Center, like the library, the 
central computer services division, the Contractor 
who removes the snow, etc. Thus, it is rather
difficult to determine what percentage of the
SSF budget doesn't go for SSF activities. To get
an accurate figure, you would have to take
the annual expenditure for the library (for example),
and then divide by the amount of the library funds
used to support SSF (which would be hard to
compute by itself - how would you figure out
what percentage of the bill for Aviation Week for
1 year is 'billable' to SSF, would you base it on
the person-hours SSF employees spend reading AV-week
versus the rest of the center personnel). You would
then have to compare this estimate of the SSF
portion of the library expense with the portion of
the tax that goes to support the library. Who knows,
maybe SSF overpays on the tax to run the library, but
we underpay for snow removal? Talk about
a burecratic nightmare!

My last point is that I can't believe your claim that
Congress has never heard of the term 'center tax.'
Unfortunately, all of the NASA testimony before
Congress isn't on a computer, so I can't do a simple
word search someplace to prove you wrong. But surely,
in some GAO audit somewhere, these NASA cost methods
were documented for Congress?



	I recently read an article in a local paper written by an Islamic
  person who was upset with the way Islam has been portrayed by western media.
  When a terrorist action takes place in the middle east, it is always played
  up as an Islamic Terrorist.  However, when the a Serbian terrorist attacks
  the Croations, its not a Christian terrorist, its just a terrorist.
	I have often tried to explain this to some close friends who believe
  the press, that Islam is somehow tied to violence.  Often times you hear
  things like "They just don't value human life like we do..." and so on.
  I was wondering if anyone out there had any suggestions for how we can
  change this image, or how I can help my friends to see that this is just 
  hype.  I would appreciate any serious suggestions or comments via e-mail,
  and I'm not interested in hearing about how right the press is.

By "they," you mean the leaders of the lds church?  I grant you that when
Joseph Smith was still alive, plenty of "accusations" were filed, most of
which had little bearing with reality, as evidenced by various verdicts.
I have studied lds history for 15 years now, and I have yet to see prove
that the lds leadership was involved, in quote: "illegal activities."
Plural marriage, yes, but your charge of "underage" wives sounds like it
could have originated from a tabloid, and discredits the high moral
standards which characterized these leaders and families, unlike, as it
appears, those of David Koresh.

#        Joseph Smith started the sect.  After he and his brother Hyram
#were murdered in a Nauvoo, Il. jail cell, church membership split over
#who to follow.  Initially, Smith was considered a prophet (just like
#Mohammed, a rather interesting parallel considering Muslims consider
#Christ to be a prophet the same as Jews, I'm led to understand.  Make
#no mistake, this was no messiah we're talking about in Smith).  The

And neither did he claim he was.  As the church reflects the moral
aptitude of its leaders (and especially those of Joseph Smith), I have
nothing but the highest respect for this inspired man, whose only "crime"
was that he refused to deny that he had seen a vision...  Many have tried
to explain the "Smith phenomenon" away, but the bold presence of an 8.5
million member strong church stands as a witness that Joseph Smith's
testimony had enough resilience and power to carry on the message.

#thought at the time was that the gift of prophecy was to be handed
#down father to son.  After Joseph Smith died, his son was only
#entering his teens.  Brigham Young and a few others claimed to have
#been bequeathed the gift and leadership prior to his death.  The
#Council of Twelve, the Church governing body, wasn't of much help
#here, and this basic conflict is still a wedge between the sects.
#Brigham Young took his followers to Salt Lake.  The rest waited
#for Smith Jr. to grow up enough to assume leadership.  The other
#claimants to the leadership were soon ignored, like Mike Dukakis. ;-)

"The rest" were apostates and excommunicated members of the Church,
while the great majority of the membership, the Twelve, and the various
auxiliary organizations, chose to accept Brigham Young as the new
prophet and leader of the Church.  If you knew your lds scriptures and
doctrine, you would have known that Brigham Young was the FIRST in
line to fill the prophet Joseph Smith's vacancy: he was the senior
apostle in the Quorum, and various comments made by Joseph indicated
that it was Brigham who would lead the latter-day exodus to the West.

Other rightful "heirs" were either dead (Hyrum Smith) or excommunicated
(Oliver Cowdery), and while persecutions abounded and intensified,
Joseph Smith had already given orders to look for a new place, an empty
land beyond the boundaries of the United States (at that time).  This
"Rekhabite" principle (pseudographia) was well understood and antipated
by the great majority of lds faithful, and was not questioned by them.

Granted, a couple of "do-it-yourselfers" stayed behind, unwilling to
sacrifice and to undertake the perilous journey to the unknown, but
this also was necessary to separate the tares from the wheat.  The
church benefitted from this purification process: they became even
more unified and willing to carry out their mission to the world.

#        Both sects practiced the "1-year food stockpile" doctrine,

#justified in making military training a good thing.  Remember,
#this was far beyond where even the US Army went, and these people
#had nobody to turn to save themselves.
#
#        Just a little context to put this all in perspective.

BTW, since when is the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (one of
the largest denominations in the country) a "sect"???  It didn't "splinter"
from any other religion, as did say, the Southern Baptists or Methodists.

What a balloney.  Suicide is sinful and against the law of God.  I am
not comfortable with this alleged "cosiness" with Mammon: I assure you
that *many* among us reject this attitude categorically.  Period.  Our
ONLY true allegiance is to our God and to the leaders which He has
appointed to represent Him.  In any regard, to read this TRASH (about
suicide and "atone for sins with blood") is yet another insulting
misrepresentation of what my church believes in and stands for...

Preposterous.  Even if this were true (reliable data, please), I
am convinced that those officers would perform to the highest codes
of honor and conduct (that's why they were selected for in the
first place, remember?).  Besides, one of our Articles of Faith
STRONGLY states the principle of freedom of religion, and that all
people are free to worship "*how*, *where*, or *what* they may."

#        If it's true, there would be little affect.  LDS and RLDS
#philosophy is that all other religions have strayed from the true
#Church as set down by Jesus, but that God will judge each on his
#own merits.  In addition, the RLDS also contend (and the LDS may
#as well) that ignorance of the True Way (tm) is an excuse.  You
#can only be condemned if you had been tought the way and rejected
#it.  In short, LDS and RLDS suffer everybody from Lutherans to
#Buddhists, secure in the knowledge that though they are wrong they
#will not be penalized for ignorance.  It is more likely that Hoover
#liked them because of their rather strict upbringings which forbade
#alcohol, tobacco, hot drink (like coffee or tea), and the like.
#These people are the "salt of the Earth" and as such are more
#easily made to follow orders and have few vices to be used against them.

A good explanation, I can accept that.  You are right that lds people
are sometimes a little too cosy with Mammon's "orders" (the late
president Kimball, for example, was an exception with his strong
opposition of the selection of the MX "Peace Keeper" missile maze

Yes.  I cannot remeber which works I read about this in, as it was many 
years ago.  This ritual was called The Tarobaullum I believe, (The

I think you would lose your money. Julius was actually rather tall
for a Roman. He did go on record as favouring small soldiers though.
Thought they were tougher and had more guts. He was probably right
if you think about it. As for Napoleon remember that the French
avergae was just about 5 feet and that height is relative! Did he

Isn't that interesting?!  In the Jewish tradition you are incredibly
wrong!  They originate in the Torah and with Jewish ancestors,
specifically the Patriarch Abraham (z"l).  That knowledge was sent East
to India and China when Abraham gave "gifts" (the commentators to Jewish
scripture say this was the knowledge of the occult arts) to all the rest
of his children when he sent them away to the East.  This assured that
Isaac only, who remained with Abraham, would inherit his most important
spiritual gifts, what eventually became Judaism.

So you see, other religions can have very parochial views too.  By the
Jewish view, you are very mistaken, your scripture are not scripture,
your gods are not gods, your practices a jumble of errors that lead
people to idol worship and away from God.  That doesn't stop us from
respecting you to the extent of not trying to convert you or proselytize
you and being willing to dialog in a respectful manner.  We're content
to let you live the way you care to live as long as you leave us be.  We
are happy to co-exist as long as you give us the same right.

But your incredible rudeness and violent nature seems to preclude that.
Too bad.  Is this typical of your religion?

You are a most presumptuous fellow!  How dare you presume that the
"typical" New Ager doesn't acknowledge God and is selfish.  What trite,
self-righteous, ego-ful garbage!  There are Buddhists, Christians, Jews,
and those of many other religions here on this newsgroups for whom your
words are simple slander.

Of course, from the Jewish perspective you are incredibly wrong.  We'd
say that there is no "godhead" -- just created beings who may be
enjoying a good laugh at your expense.

So not only are we selfish, we are also thieves and liars!  And you

NASA and related agencies apparently used this same principles to create
the loudest reported reproduced sound. They used an "analog" electrically
controlled valve to control the flow of air across a horn throat. If I 
remember correctly it was called a "modulated air blast transducer". There
were reports of the thing being able to produce 106 dB @ 80 Hz @ 10 mile
distance, communicate directly with fighter pilots @ 5000 ft, etc.

                       MARS OBSERVER STATUS REPORT
                             April 23, 1993
                              10:00 AM PDT

Flight Sequence C8 is active, the Spacecraft subsystems and instrument
payload performing well in Array Normal Spin and outer cruise
configuration, with uplink and downlink via the High Gain Antenna; uplink
at 125 bps, downlink at the 2 K Engineering data rate.

As a result of the spacecraft entering Contingency Mode on April 9, all
payload instruments were automatically powered off by on-board fault
protection software.  Gamma Ray Spectrometer Random Access Memory
was successfully reloaded on Monday, April 19.  To prepare for
Magnetometer Calibrations which were rescheduled for execution in Flight
Sequence C9 on Tuesday and Wednesday of next week, a reload of Payload
Data System Random Access Memory will take place this morning
beginning at 10:30 AM.

Over this weekend, the Flight Team will send real-time commands to
perform Differential One-Way Ranging to obtain additional data for
analysis by the Navigation Team.  Radio Science Ultra Stable Oscillator
testing will take place on Monday .

The Flight Sequence C9 uplink will occur on Sunday, April 25, with
activation at Midnight, Monday evening April 26.  C9 has been modified to
include Magnetometer Calibrations which could not be performed in C8 due
to Contingency Mode entry on April 9.  These Magnetometer instrument
calibrations will allow the instrument team to better characterize the
spacecraft-generated magnetic field and its effect on their instrument.
This information is critical to Martian magnetic field measurements
which occur during approach and mapping phases. MAG Cals will require
the sequence to command the spacecraft out of Array Normal Spin state
and perform slew and roll maneuvers to provide the MAG team data points
in varying spacecraft attitudes and orientations.

Today, the spacecraft is 22,971,250 km (14,273,673 mi.) from Mars
travelling at a velocity of 2.09 kilometers/second (4,677 mph) with
respect to Mars.  One-way light time is approximately 10 minutes, 38
seconds.

A 1 of 4 decoder need not be the same as a 1 to 4 demultiplexer, although
many commercial SSI implementations allow you to use one as such. Strictly,
a 1 of 4 decoder need only take two lines in and make one output change
state, according to the inputs.

A demux, on the other hand, uses two control inputs to determine which
of four outputs will reflect the state of the input signal. So there are
three inputs required.

A decoder can be used as a demux if it is equipped with an output enable
input, since this can be used as the data input (e.g. when high, all
outputs are high; when low, only the selected (by control inputs) output
will be low).

An eight way decoder is created by using the high order bit (bit 2) to
select which of two four way demuxes is enabled. Thus you achieve your
aim of having only one output of eight reflecting the input bits. Note
that this method cannot be used to create a true eight way demux, since
you have no data input (the enable line on a four way decoder) left
once you commit the enable lines to their intended purpose.

A sixteen way decoder obviously requires four, four-way decoders, plus
a mechanism to enable only one of the four at a time. Therefore, use
the fifth decoder, attached to the two high order bits, to provide the
four enable lines.

Of course, the two low order bits must be connected in parallel to the
four final stage decoders.

Please give me the credit when you submit your homework.

The speed limit on commuter tracks in the northeast is 120MPH.  We
already have something that resembles high speed rail in this
country and it requires massive government subsidies.  We don't need
another government boondoggle.

   problem with 3He (aside from the difficulty in making any fusion
   reactor work) is that its concentration in lunar regolith is just so
   small -- on the order of 5 ppb or so, on average (more in some

   This thread reminds me of Wingo's claims some time ago about the moon

   even 1% of the basalts are 5% TiO2, this is trillions of tons of TiO2
   at concentrations only a factor of 2-3 less than in lunar high-Ti
   basalts.  It is difficult to see how the disadvantages of the moon
   could be overcome by such a small increase the concentration of the
   ore (never mind the richer, but less common, terrestrial ores being
   mined today).

Why Paul, it's obvious.
Once chlorine chemistry has been banned on Earth,
as is being advocated by some groups, Ti prices will
sharply increase (we are of course not allowed to
assume any developments in Ti processing).
Lunar Ti will then be eminently competitive for
the trendy jewelry market and certain applications
of National Importance 

:-) :-) :-) 


(oops, this is sci.space... wrong rules of debate ;-)


Seriously, I'd say there is a flaw in Gary's analysis
in that he assumes an export oriented economy, maybe
the lunatics will just want some native Ti for local
use... as to why Lunar natives are cost effective, 
analysis has shown they will be critical in providing
a sheltered manufacturing base, technological innovation,
critical materials and manpower in the war between
the Allies and Central Powers in about two hundred years...

    COMPUTING CRATER DIAMETERS FROM EARTH-IMPACTING ASTEROIDS

    An RMS velocity of V = 20 km/sec may be used for Earth-crossing
    asteroids.

    Under these assumptions, the body which created the Barringer Meteor
    Crater in Arizona (1.13 km diameter) would have been about 40 meters in

    MAP PROJECTIONS AND SPHERICAL TRIGNOMETRY

    Two easy-to-find sources of map projections are the "Encyclopaedia
    Brittanica", (particularly the older volumes) and a tutorial appearing
    in _Graphics Gems_ (Academic Press, 1990). The latter was written with
    simplicity of exposition and suitability of digital computation in mind
    (spherical trig formulae also appear, as do digitally-plotted examples).

    More than you ever cared to know about map projections is in John
    Snyder's USGS publication "Map Projections--A Working Manual", USGS
    Professional Paper 1395. This contains detailed descriptions of 32
    projections, with history, features, projection formulas (for both
    spherical earth and ellipsoidal earth), and numerical test cases. It's a
    neat book, all 382 pages worth. This one's $20.

    You might also want the companion volume, by Snyder and Philip Voxland,
    "An Album of Map Projections", USGS Professional Paper 1453. This
    contains less detail on about 130 projections and variants. Formulas are
    in the back, example plots in the front. $14, 250 pages.

    You can order these 2 ways. The cheap, slow way is direct from USGS:
    Earth Science Information Center, US Geological Survey, 507 National
    Center, Reston, VA 22092. (800)-USA-MAPS. They can quote you a price and
    tell you where to send your money. Expect a 6-8 week turnaround time.

    A much faster way (about 1 week) is through Timely Discount Topos,
    (303)-469-5022, 9769 W. 119th Drive, Suite 9, Broomfield, CO 80021. Call
    them and tell them what you want. They'll quote a price, you send a
    check, and then they go to USGS Customer Service Counter and pick it up
    for you. Add about a $3-4 service charge, plus shipping.

    A (perhaps more accessible) mapping article is:

	R. Miller and F. Reddy, "Mapping the World in Pascal",
	Byte V12 #14, December 1987

	Contains Turbo Pascal procedures for five common map projections. A
	demo program, CARTOG.PAS, and a small (6,000 point) coastline data
	is available on CompuServe, GEnie, and many BBSs.

    THREE-DIMENSIONAL STAR/GALAXY COORDINATES

    To generate 3D coordinates of astronomical objects, first obtain an
    astronomical database which specifies right ascension, declination, and
    parallax for the objects. Convert parallax into distance using the
    formula in part 6 of the FAQ, convert RA and declination to coordinates
    on a unit sphere (see some of the references on planetary positions and
    spherical trignometry earlier in this section for details on this), and
    scale this by the distance.

    Two databases useful for this purpose are the Yale Bright Star catalog
    (sources listed in FAQ section 3) or "The Catalogue of Stars within 25
    parsecs of the Sun" (in pub/SPACE/FAQ/stars.data and stars.doc on

   I need some advice on having someone ride pillion with me on my 750 Ninja.
   This will be the the first time I've taken anyone for an extended ride
   (read: farther than around the block  :-).  We'll be riding some twisty, 
   fairly bumpy roads (the Mines Road-Mt.Hamilton Loop for you SF Bay Areans).

Communication:  work out your own system.  Or just slow down and holler
back every once in a while.  At reasonable speeds, even on my under-muffled
Magna, we can hear each other.  It's only above, say, 45 MPH that you 
can't really communicate.

Balance: New passengers are a real pain, because you never know how
they're going to react to steering.  Some people catch on immediately
and lean with me.  Others are completely skittish about the leaning
thing, and keep their bodies perpendicular to the horizon.  This is a
pain while turning, but manageable.  The WORST are the passengers who stay
perpendicular to the horizon, then REMEMBER in the middle of a turn
and WHIP AROUND until they're in the `correct' position.  This always
screws up the line I've picked out.

Here's my personal checklist of things to tell passengers:
	- attire: helmet, long pants, boots/heavy shoes, jacket.
	- Keep feet on pegs at all times, unless I say otherwise.  Do not
	  get on/off unless I say you can.  (I've had people try to dismount
	  in traffic, just as I'm pulling in to a parking space!)
	- Muffler gets HOT! ('Nuff said)
	- We get *GOOD* traction.  We're not going to fall over.  (Many
	  first-time riders are surprised by how tightly you can turn!)
	- Turn dynamics:  sit so that you feel like you're sitting upright and
	  we're going straight.  Trust your butt, not your eyes -- if you're
	  confused, close your eyes for a couple of turns to get the feel
	  of it.  Or just hug me tight.  
	- Please, no sudden moves -- shift your weight as desired, but be 
	  gradual, so I can compensate.
	- Your faceplate is yours to open/close as desired.
	- Trust is essential.  Trust the driver (me) to do the right 
	  thing -- I've driven many miles on this thing, and know how
	  to operate it.  Enjoy the ride.  (This is important to
	  stress.  For example, one of my first-time passwngers seemed to 
	  watch the speedo like a hawk:  I drove her to the beach down 84, 
	  and whever we topped 35 mph, she'd holler, "SLOW DOWN! I'M SCARED" 
	  I humored her for a while, then simply covered the speedometer with 
	  the spare piece of duct tape I keep stuck to the top of the cluster.
	  Problem solved:  she watched the scenery instead of the
	  instruments, and had a much better time.  Based on her
	  experience driving a Lincoln Continental, she was unwilling to 
	  trust my ability to choose a safe speed for the bike.)

Usually I'll point out the controls, engine, transmission, brakes, 
tires, etc. and discuss motorcycle physics a bit too for first-timers.
Helps calm their nerves, and gives the bike a chance to warm up.

Watch out for gravel on the Mt. Hamilton road:  there were lots of little
mudslides after the last big rain; by now, many of the blind corners will
be nicely covered with a carpet of little, round, nearly invisible stones.
It doesn't help build trust when you slide out on a blind corner, on the 
first trip!

Good luck -- have fun!

Take a lemon.  Stick a copper strip into the lemon.  Stick a galvanized
nail in about 1 to 1-1/2 inches from the copper strip.  You should get
about 1/2 volt from it - enough to light an LED.

You still need to supply a proper ground for a Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter!
So rewiring is still a part of this job, however, the ground may be connected to
a local earth ground, rather than back at the breaker box.

As Jamie said, GFCI devices are required by code in a number of places, most
notably: bathrooms, and outside the house.  I do suggest the use of GFCI outlets,
rather than the breakers.  You will end up with much less headaches.  Noise pickup
in long cable runs is sometimes enough to cause frequent tripping of the breakers.

GFCI devices do save lives, if you decide to install them, be sure to check them
regularly (using the test button).

Running the family business (electrical supplies and lighting) for many years, I
have seen too many seasoned electricians fried, because they forgot to double check
their common sense list.  Please exercise caution.

Hams are unlikely to have an illegal amp,  and are also unlikely to
have a "dirty" amp.

   Hams can legally run up to 1500 watts.  It is very unlikely, however,
   that a ham would be running that kind of power from a car.  Ham rigs

Not possible either.  You'd need about a 300 amp alternator for
just the amplifier.  I can just see it.  You need to slow
down on a downgrade,  so you hit the push to talk button.

   for cars put out around 100 watts.  It is possible that a 100 watt
   radio would cause interference to consumer electronic 100 feet 
   away.  Most TVs, stereos, and VCRs have very poor RF shielding.
   If you experience the problem frequently, it may be 
   caused by a ham, CBer, or other radio operator in a base station
   nearby.    The interference may have been caused by a radio 
   transmitter used for other purposes, such as police, fire,
   etc.  If you heard voices over your stereo, I think you are
   correct in assuming that the source is an RF transmitter.

   If you have frequent trouble, you may want to try the RF ferrite
   chokes available at Radio Shack.  The interference is probably
   being picked up by your speaker wires, and those chokes can
   be installed on the wires very easily (without cutting them).
   Good instructions are included with the chokes.
   If that does not solve the problem, you may want to search your
   neighborhood for a radio operator.  Look for antennas on the roof
   or car.  Talk to him/her about your problem.  There are things
   a radio operator can do to reduce interference.

And please remember to be friendly when approaching your
local radio operator.  This person may or may not be the 
cause of your troubles,  and you'll get better cooperation
and help if you assume that he is going to be helpful (most
are).  It was amazing the accusations that we sometimes
dealt with as I grew up.  We were blamed for skip (ghost
pictures on the TV that occur at sunspot peaks),  c.b.
interferance,  dead grass :),  you name it.  

BTW, the local operator should try and help you whether or
not he or she is directly responsible.  It is part of
being a good neighbor and that is how the FCC views it.
Too bad they don't require the consumer equipment makers
to take any precautions.

Last, you can usually tell ham radio vs. CB.  Ham operators are
required to declare their call (sign) every so many minutes (no more
than 10).  So if you hear "This is WA1QT" or some other call starting
with A, W or K and no more than 6 total characters, you heard a ham.
CB'ers probably won't sign (I don't know that they're even required
to) and fire/police have other private ids.

Psalm85(JPS): For the leader. Of the Korahites. A psalm. O LORD, You
will favor Your land, restore Jacob's fortune; You will forgive Your
people's iniquity, pardon all their sins; Selah; You will withdraw all Your
anger, turn away from Your rage. Turn again, O God, our helper, revoke
Your displeasure with us. Will you be angry with us forever, prolong
Your wrath for all generations? Surely You will revive us again, so that
Your people may rejoice in You. Show us, O LORD, Your faithfulness;
grant us Your deliverance. Let me hear what God, the LORD, will speak;
He will promise well-being to His people, His faithful ones; may they
not turn to folly. His help is very near those who fear Him, to make His
glory dwell in our land. Faithfulness and truth meet; justice and
well-being kiss. Truth springs up from the earth; justice looks down
from heaven. The LORD also bestows His bounty; our land yields its
produce. Justice goes before Him as He sets out on His way.

Jehovah's Witnesses do not believe that Christians are required to observe
the Sabbath, whether it is on Saturday or Sunday.  The Sabbath was part
of a Covenent between God and the Israelites and is not required for
Christians.

:
 (lots of stuff about the Nicene Creed deleted which can be read in the
  original basenote.  I will also leave it up to other LDS netters to
  take Mr. Weiss to task on using Mormon Doctrine to declare the difinitive
  word on what the LDS Church teaches as doctrine.  Hopefully the LDS 
  netters will be amiable in their explanation.)

Since it would do no good to rebut what Mr. Weiss has stated on the origin
of the Nicene Creed and its status as devine and inspired (I say "no good"
because it cannot be proved through discussion or debate as to whether or not 
the authors of the Creed were inspired), I leave you (it will be some time 
before I post again) with the following thought authored by Eugene England, 
Professor of English at Brigham Young University.  Mr. England wrote the 
following as part of a book review section in This People's magazine (Spring 
1993 edition):

  "I conclude with a little sermon because I believe we will not be a Mormon--
  or human--family until we can get over labeling and rejecting each other 
  with terms like feminist or patriarchal, liberal or conservative (Christian 
  or non-Christian -- Hal 8^).  When we are tempted to draw a circle around
  a set of beliefs and traditions and styles and call it American, then exclude
  those who don't fit, it may be well to consider that perhaps the most central
  defining characteristic of a good American might be "one who doesn't draw
  exclusive circles" -- that the surest way of excluding ourselves from the 
  central American ideal is by excluding others.  And when we are tempted to
  draw a circle around "Mormon" or "Christian," to decide who is "orthodox"
  and who isn't by how much they agree with us, it might be well to consider
  that the central pillar of Christ's "orthodoxy" is our ability to love
  unconditionally those who are different and include them in our family.

  "I recently spent some time in a "Christian" bookstore in California. The
  service was excellent, the clerks and customers all smiling, neat, and
  well-scrubbed, and there were the expected wholesome offerings of scriptural
  commentaries, sentimental fiction, and collections of evangelistic sermons.
  But I was dismayed to find how much shelf space was given to attacking 
  others, often viciously---whether the political left, our modern American
  culture, or other religions.  A whole section was devoted to "Cults and the
  Occult," and as you might expect, Mormonism was right there under the same
  rubric and indictment (often by the same authors) as Satanism.  And I found
  I could either rent or buy (in English or Spanish) copies of The God Makers
  (that absurdly inaccurate, even libelous, but very popular and dangerous
  anti-Mormon film that uses exaclty the same techniques and even accusations
  of the Nazi films that scapegoated Jews in the 1930s).

  "It seems to me one major indication that a person is a genuine convert to
  Christ and his redemptive love is his lack of paranoia and anxiety ("Perfect
  love casteth out fear," I John 4:18).  I have always been pleased that the
  LDS Church has not engaged in attacks on other faiths, though I find a 
  disheartening increase in willingness of individual Mormons to engage in the
  same kinds of stereotyping and scapegoating---and even threats of coercive
  action---as the "religious right wing" has launched this year against the
  political left and American cultural and religious styles they don't like.
  It is a fearful irony that in so doing Mormons take common cause with the
  very people who have most slanderously attacked Mormons---people who would,
  if they had power, forcefully restrict Mormons' rights along with those of
  others they believe to be evil."


The above "sermon" was addressed to the LDS audience who usually subscribe
to This People's magazine, but would certainly apply to all of us who
rely on the mercies and grace of Jesus Christ to bring us back into His
arms.  

Even though the LDS Church claims devine authority to exercise the principles 
of the restored gospel---as in the days of Christ, the Church does not claim 
perfection and infallibility in how those with authoritative status have or do 
now lead the Church.  I, for one, do not wish to be labelled "Christian", if 
those who profess themselves as Christians attack my beliefs because they are 
intollerent (for example) of the way my religion may interpret Biblical 
scriptures of the same source to have a different meaning and implication 
than mainstream Christianity would give it.  Once again, being in the 
majority does NOT in and of itself PROVE anything except that your collective 
voice is louder.  That's really all the critics of the LDS Church have to stand
on in terms of the kind of Biblical interpretation used as proof to counter 
the LDS Church' interpretation!  Using someone elses biased research of truths 
and non-truths (whose to say what the mixture is?) as an authoritative tool to 
disprove or discredit is not being fair to anyone, least of all themselves. 
Let us simply agree to disagree, and share beliefs through adult discussion 
and conversation, thereby uplifting everyone.

   Geez, where have you been, Ryan?  I proposed this theory *months*
ago.  Let's take it one step further, even.  If, as the surveys show,
up to 33% of all men have *had* a homosexual encounter, then there must
be an even *larger* percentage of people who have had homosexual erotic
fantasies.  But if less than 10% of the population is gay, what can we
say about these people who don't identify as gay but have demonstrated
gay potential.  Obviously, a large chunk of these people *chose* (or,
more accurately, were forced to choose by force of religion and social
sanction) to put those feelings aside, to be heterosexual.

   Obviously, Cramer and Kaldis fall into this category.

   These people are the ones who are so hung up on "choice."
Obviously, since *they chose*, everyone must have, and homosexuals are
just flaunting their "perversion" by choosing not to go along with what
society has dictated.

   Of course, I'm that most awful of perverts.  I chose, I gleefully
admit that I was heterosexual until I met the right man and *chose* to
indulge in my homoerotic potential.  Take that!

So let's see what we have on the Batdude so far: He has a weird helmet.
He drags his knee in corners (thanks, Cookson, but how does he do it?
Hidden Bat-pucks?), and he only takes the bike out in the snow or rain.
Also, he lets Robin ride! I think I could have used a Bat-mom. Would
have made getting my license a lot easier!

There's a trend here: Stylish helmet, Stylish knee-dragging, rides only
in Stylish cartoon precipitation. Hmm . . . Could it be that we're
dealing with a veritable airborne mammalian poseur? Dare I say it, a
BAT-SQUID?? (huh? Bat-Squid?) It all adds up now . . .

Let's make the B-man an honorary DoD DuDe. All he needs is a DoD
sticker.

Actually, anyone have an address for Batman's current artists, both
comic book and animated series? We'll write and ask if Batman would like
to become an honorary Denizen! Yeah!

Special To The KoTL: Is there a precedent for inducting an imaginary
member with an imaginary motorcycle? Having seen the computers in the
Bat-Cave, I think we can safely assume that he also has imaginary
Internet access.

1. Can low Voltage lights be controlled with an X10  module by putting it 
before the transformer? It seems to work, even the dimmer works. Not very 
reliable. Will it damage the module? Can it be done reliably?

2. I put a motion switch (Heath) to a low voltage light, it worked but now it is
broken, too much current? How can I get arround that? 
  
3. How can I increase the intensity of a light using the X10 PC computer
interface without having it go 100% on first and then down. I am doing
my own programing, not the X10 program.

One day out riding, my friend and i were passing a field of goats and
noticed 2 out on the road. As we slowed to pass the ram made a dash at 
my friend just missing him and then tangling it self up in the barb wire
fence. Being good samaritains and generally nice guys we turned around to 
untrangle the goat from the barbed wire. As I pulled up next to him
(seeing him still tangled up), stopped the bike and got off the Goat had
vanished (into the field I guess).

                              TRANSLATION

 The Vedas deal mainly with the subject of the three modes of material
nature. O Arjuna, become transcendental to these three modes. Be free
from all dualities and from all anxieties for gain and safety, and be
established in the self.
  
                                PURPORT

 All material activities involve actions and reactions in the three
modes of material nature. They are meant for fruitive results, which
cause bondage in the material world. The Vedas deal mostly with fruitive
activities to gradually elevate the general public from the field of
sense gratification to a position on the transcendental plane. Arjuna,
as a student and friend of Lord Krsna, is advised to raise himself to
the transcendental position of Vedanta philosophy where, in the
beginning, there is brahma-jijnasa, or questions on the supreme
transcendence. All the living entities who are in the material world are
struggling very hard for existence. For them the Lord, after creation of
the material world, gave the Vedic wisdom advising how to live and get
rid of the material entanglement. When the activities for sense
gratification, namely the karma-kanda chapter, are finished, then the
chance for spiritual realization is offered in the form of the
Upanisads, which are part of different Vedas, as the Bhagavad-gita is a
part of the fifth Veda, namely the Mahabharata. The Upanisads mark the
beginning of transcendental life.

 As long as the material body exists, there are actions and reactions in
the material modes. One has to learn tolerance in the face of dualities
such as happiness and distress, or cold and warmth, and by tolerating
such dualities become free from anxieties regarding gain and loss. This
transcendental position is achieved in full Krsna consciousness when one
is fully dependent on the good will of Krsna.

If he's not, I will.  Put two riders on identical machines.  It's the
one who knows what he's doing, and why, that will be faster.  It *may*
be possible to improve your technique if you have no idea what it is,
through trial and error, but it is not very effective methodology.
Only by understanding the technique of steering a motorcycle can one
improve on that technique (I hold that this applies to any human
endeavor).

>that's all it is - an interesting bit of knowledge, and to claim that
>it is essential for all bikers to know it, or that you can corner faster
>or better as a result, is absurd.

Do you consider an understanding of the physics of traction absurd?
Are you seriously suggesting that one can form a traction management
policy without understanding what it is or what factors increase or
decrease available traction?  Braking?

It is highly unlikely that any biker is going to develop his maximum
swerving ability without any knowledge of turning techniques.  For most
of his riding life this may not be a problem, but in an emergency
situation it is very definately placing him at a disadvantage.

>But by including countersteering
>theory in newbie courses we are confusing people unnecessarily, right at
>the time when there are *far* more important matters for them to learn.

I disagree.  The existance and immense success of riding courses which
teach the technique indicate that the concept can be taught in a manner
that is neither confusing, nor detracts from any other aspects of the
course.

>And that was my original point.

Perhaps, but in the ensuing discussion, you strayed far from that
point, to claim that knowledge of steering technique is irrelevant to a
rider's ability.  I find this assertion ludicrous.

Damn right. I was late for a climbing meet one morning, so I got
out of bed without bothering that my right foot was still asleep.
It reminded me by folding underneath with a crunching of Metatarsals.
Lucky the brake's on the right, but i got funny looks riding thru

I must correct the following in my previous posting:

: share much of the same material

I should have been a bit more careful here - the gospels not only
tell us about the same events, they usually use the same wordings.
Textual analyses show that Matthew and Luke probably had a common
source, which may have influenced Mark, too.

Also would maybe get the Russians Involved. After all they do have the resources
to do it in part.. But they need the capital and the goal..

I wonder if renting the russians resources would be a disqualification?

Just for reference, here's the earlier quote:

These are two conflicting statements.  To say one is a clarification of the
other is a breach of logic.  I don't mind people shifting their position on
an issue.  It irritates me when it is said under the premise that no change
was made.  What about Deuteronomy 22:20-25?  Is it wrong now?  Did Jesus
change that?

: If anything, He clarified the Law such as in that quote you made.  In the
: following verses, Jesus takes several portions of the Law and expounds upon
: the Law giving clearer meaning to what God intended.

Sure he does this.  However, he doesn't address the notion of stoning
non-virgin brides, because this needs no clarification.  Are you going to
deny that Deuteronomy 22:20-25 is not patently clear in its intent?

I'll agree that there is a lot of modern day Pharisees that know the Bible
from end to end and don't believe in it.  Depending on how they use this
knowledge, they can be scary.  They can argue any position they desire, and
back it up with selected parts of the Bible.  Such Pharisees include David
Koresh and Adolph Hitler.  I will qualify this by saying *I don't know* if
they actually believed what they were preaching, but the ends certainly
made the means look frightening.

However, just as scary are those that don't know much of the Bible, but
believe every word.  In fact, this is probably scarier, since there are far
more of these people, from what I've seen.  In addition, they are very easy
to manipulate by the aforementioned Pharisees, since they don't know enough
to debate with these people.

: Christianity is not just a set of rules; it's a lifestyle that changes one's
: perspectives and personal conduct.  And it demands obedience to God's will.

No, it demands obedience to a book.  If God came down and personally told
me how I should behave, then I would say that I would be doing God's will
by doing it.  However, if preachers, pastors, and evangelists tell me to
obey the will of a book written by people who have been dead for close to
two millenia (even longer for the OT), even if I follow everything in it
with my heart, I could scarcely be honest with myself by saying I'm doing
the will of God.

: Some people can live by it, but many others cannot or will not.  That is
: their choice and I have to respect it because God respects it too.

Well, if God respects it so much, how come there is talk in the Bible about

the god of the Bible.  I see a selfish and spiteful god.

Wasn't there a "plain" flavor too?  They looked more like some
kind of extruded industrial product than food -- perfectly
smooth cylinders with perfectly smooth ends.  Kinda scary.

An other post described it as like a "microwaved Tootsie Roll" --
which captures the texture pretty well.  As for taste, they were
like candy, only not very sweet -- does that make sense? I recall
liking them for their texture, not taste. I guess I have well
developed texture buds.

It was obligatory to eat a few while watching "Captain Scarlet".
Does anybody else remember _that_, as long as we're off the

And the religious right worships engines, smokestacks, landfills,
and hates people.

What does this name-calling have to do with anything you are claiming about
the truth of environmental disaster?  Nothing that I have read in this
thread, nor heard from anyone I have talked to, would suggest to me that 
people fit the definition you give of the religious left.  Come off it, Phil.
A prime motivation for protecting our environment is so that we, 
people, can continue to live in it healthily.  We just disagree on what
is necessary to maintaining a healthy environment FOR PEOPLE.

What!? They have already repaired that old hulk!!!?  WOW!!! ;-)

I suppose you *mean* the Alaskan shores that were devastated by the
Valdez accident?  I haven't seen the articles.  What do they say exactly?
Has [mostly] all the ocean and shore life returned?  The sands are [mostly]
as clean as they were before?  The microbial samples are [mostly] back to 
a normal balance? The fish and fowl populations have [mostly] returned?  What?

Not a problem?  Would you move to Three Mile Island?  I would imagine 
there is some cheap property available!  

The naturally occurring catastrophic events [disasters] that destroy 
property (ie: hurricanes, tornados, earthquakes) do not usually leave 
toxic wastes that prevent people from re-building their lives there.  
The man-made disasters (oil spills, toxic dumping, radioactive waste 
dispersions) cause death and make an area unliveable far beyond the 
initial event.

Thanks for typing that in, Steven.  Sounds like a "fall back and
regroup" strategy session.

I wanted to add that my copy of the brochure arrived with a flattering
cover letter:

"Invitations are being extended to those who have demonstrated a
strong committment to space program development and have been
influential in its advancement.  We sincerely hope you will be able to
attend."

Wow! I wonder which of my contributions to the conquest of space
convinced them to send me this letter?

I hope you decide to go, Pat.  The Net can use some eyes and ears
there...

I am having trouble obtaining the specified standby current drain from
a MC146818A Real Time Clock.  Has anyone out there had some experience
in doing this?  The specs call for a few sequences to be met before
standby mode is activated, and are a bit hard to decipher on that, but
I thought that I had it worked out.  However, with a 32kHz crystal the
lowest current drain I can acheive at 3.7V Vcc is 150uA.  This is
three times the specified MAXIMUM under the conditions I am attempting
to create.

I have done the following things:

1) Made sure that RESET/ is asserted for Trlh after powerup, and AS is
   low during this time.


2) Made sure that there is a cycle on AS after the negation of RD/ or
   WR/ during which STBY/ was asserted.

What am I doing wrong?

Thanks very much,

Martin.


Hello.


I just read my first newspaper in a while and noticed an article on a
'messianic cult' leader named 'David Koresh'.

I'd like to know more about this and what is going on with them.

Sorry folks, I should have done this, and meant to just after i hit the 
send key...

Orbital Elements of Comet 1977VII (from Dance files)

p(au)          3.424346
e              0.151899
i              1.0988
cap_omega(0) 243.5652
W(0)         231.1607
epoch       1977.04110

Also, perihelions of Gehrels3 were:

April  1973     83 jupiter radii
August 1970     ~3 jupiter radii

Hope this helps...I'm even less of an orbital mechanic than I am an artist.

Can I suggest the University of Western Australia in Perth.
The weathers great, the people are great and our Electronic Engineering department is great.
I am a first year student here ... so I don't know much about what projects but I do know they have a good reputation in the fields of dsp and communications.  Ever heard of QPSX?  The people who own are ex-UWA ... so that gives an indication of what the department is like.

For your information:

I hooked up my ImageWriter I to my COM1 serial port and used the C-Itoh
8510 driver in Windows 3.1.  The cable I am using is a straight-thru
cable connected to a Null Modem Adapter I got at Radio Shack (catalog
#26-1496a) for $4.95.  It seems to work fine with both DOS and Windows.
I used the following command in DOS

	C:\DOS\mode COM1:9600,n,8,1,p

and set up the port the same way in the Windows Ports setup.

the Null Modem connections are as follows:

	1	to	1
	2	to	3
	3	to	2
	4	to	5
	5	to	4
	6+8	to	20
	20	to	6+8
	7	to	7

I printed from several applications and all seems OK.

What is happening is this:
1) You turn the TV on.
2) The horizontal output begins normal operation.  This powers up the
   high voltage and most of the rest of the circuitry.
3) A problem is sensed and the horizontal oscillator shuts down.
4) After it powers down the cycle repeats.

Things to check:
First check for a shorted high power component.  Your best bet is the vertical
output transistor(s) or, if there is one, the voltage regulator.  The most
common cause of this type of failure is too much current being drawn
somewhere.
Also look for shutdown circuits (which your TV may or may not have),
if you can find one that is shutting down the horizontal oscillator
then it shouldn't be too hard to find the problem from there.

There were many injustices in the middle ages.  And this is truely sad.
I would hate to see a day when churches put people to death or torchured
them for practicing homosexuality, or any other crime.  The church is not
called to take over the governments of the world.  It may be that homosexuals
treated cruelly today, but that does not mean that we should teach 
Christians to practice homosexual immorality.  Do you think that we should
also teach Christians to practice divination and channelling because
the witches in the middle ages were persecuted.

And you accuse me of judging?  When did you look into my heart and see
if I have love.  I have been writing that we should not teach Christians
to practice homosexual immorality, and you pretend to have divine knowledge
to look into my heart.  I can't say that I love homosexuals as I should-
I can't say that I love my neighbor as I should either.  I don't know
very many homosexuals as it is.  

But Jesus loves homosexuals, just as He loves everyone else.  If His love
were conditional, I not know Him at all.  Yes.  We should show love to 
homosexuals, but it is not love to encourage brothers in the church to 
stumble and continue in their sin.  That is a very damaging and dangerous 
thing.

That is slander.   I could just as easily say  that NAMBLA has been able
to implement legislation to make child molesting easier because of
the tearing down of societies morality due to people accepting homosexuality
as normal, and that this is what you are embracing.  I do believe
that homosexual sex is immoral, that does not mean I endorse using violence
against them.  There is a problem of hatred in the church.  But there
is also the problem of what has been called "unsanctified mercy."
Many in the conservative churches have seen the moral breakdown in 
this country and the storm on the horizon, and have gotten militant in 
the flesh.  This is truely sad.  Yet others in other churches have 
embraced immorality in society, and have pointed to the carnality in the
conservative churches to justify their actions.  

>Why don't we just stick to the positive and find ways to bring people

Certainly we should not use a bullwhip to drive people from Jesus.
But we shouldn't water down the gospel to draw people in.  Jesus didn't
go out of His way to show only what might be considered positive aspects
to draw people in.  He told one man to sell all He had.  He told
another not to say good bye to His family.  His words were hard at times.
We should present people with the cost of the tower before we allow them
to begin construction.  many people have already been innoculated to the
gospel.

Sorry to put a damper on your plans, but I was there three weeks ago and
it wasn't there.  Not that I would have known to look for it, of course,
but I combed the space exhibits pretty thoroughly and something like that
would have caught my attention instantly.

Here in the UK, the bandwidth restriction apparently only apply to 
local lines.. ie those used by the average domestic client. Private
lines which are run from the local exchange to the leasing client are 
usually capable of a higher bandwidth if the exchange is digital.

Don't quote me on that..... But I think I remember a BT engineer 
saying something to that effect when I was doing some work
shadowing a few years ago.

----------
The '84 GL1200A hit the traps at 13.34 according to Cycle magazine. Yeah,
they depreciate faster than Harleys for the first couple of years then
they bottom out. Got my '86 GL1200I w/ 2275 miles on the odometer for
just under $5K in May of 1990 and would ask for $4500 now with almost
16K miles onnit....that's about 50% of what a new GL1500I would cost.

Think the '86 GL1200I originally sold for $6500 brand new, not sure. 
If that's the case then it depreciated 30.77% over 7 years or a mere
$2000. Big Fat Hairy Deal! Based on what I know, Harleys tend to
depreciate your monies far more than the initial depreciation of
the bike itself when it comes to parts and service. All this about
Harleys holding their value better doesn't always wash away the
knocks on them...such as being much slower. ;-)

How incredibly fucking stupid.  Of *course* the text is referring to the city
itself (buildings, bricks, mortar, etc.)  Otherwise it makes no sense to
refer to the future of Tyre as being reduced to nothing but a _place_ to spread 
fishing nets.

Is there any twisting of text or semantic game that you *won't* do to preserve 
your faith from admission of error, DeCenso?

I've experienced this, back when I was young(er) and (more) foolish...

My first bike used to track extremely true.  Going down the highway,
I would set the throttle tension screw up enough to hold the gas
steady, slide back on the seat and lean against the backrest, riding
without any hands.  If I needed to turn, I'd shift my weight into the
turn, and lo and behold, the bike would turn, sans touching the bars!
Granted, it wouldn't turn very fast, but it proves that you can turn
a bike without countersteering, at least not in terms of the input
to the bar normally associated with countersteering.

As I've said, I know many people who think all you do is lean, and any
input they're giving to the bar is totally unconscious.  Whereas that
may be sufficient to get you down the road under normal circumstances,
possibly for years at a stretch, I can't think of anybody who'd argue
that this is preferable to properly knowing how to manipulate the bar
in a turn, regardless of what you want to call it.

Except maybe for Mr. Sixsmith...  ;^)

I think this is a weak argument.  The fact is, there are *two* references to
Jesus in _Antiquities of the Jews_, one of which has unquestionably at least
been altered by Christians.  Origen wrote, in the third century, that
Josephus did not recognize Jesus as the Messiah, while the long passage
says the opposite.  There is an Arabic manuscript of _Antiquities of the
Jews_ which contains a version of the passage which is much less gung-ho
for Jesus and may be authentic.
   There is no question that Origen, in the third century, saw a reference
to Jesus in Josephus.  There are no manuscripts of _Antiquities_ which
lack the references.

It is possible that it was fabricated out of whole cloth and inserted, but
I don't think it's very likely--nor do I think there is a consensus in
the scholarly community that this is the case. (I know G.A. Wells takes
this position, but that's because he takes the very small minority view
that Jesus never existed.  And he is a professor of German, not of
biblical history or New Testament or anything directly relevant to
the historicity of Jesus.)

had an instructor who didn't have a degree at all, but because he had
been Minister of Culture for the Black Panthers, he was teaching anyway.
He had a bad habit of usually not showing up to teach the class, and
finally quit in disgust at the racism of a university that expected him
to show up to teach.

# a university you have professors with PhDs and then Teaching Assistants (TAs).
# TAs were the slave labor, graduate students who got their tuition paid, and
# a few hundred a month for living expenses in exchange for doing all the grunt
# work.  The professors taught the lectures, with 100 to 500 students per class,
# then the TAs taught the labs, with 20 to 30 per class.
# 
# Tim Fogarty (FOGARTY@SIR-C.JPL.NASA.GOV)

At Sonoma State University, typical class size is 20 to 30 per class.
Teaching is definitely more the goal, and sometimes, it actually happens.
The best professors at Sonoma State U. are equivalent to the best 
professors I had at UCLA and USC.

I need to find a UART that will interface to an 8051 and do the following:
	-250k baud, 8 data bits, 2 stop bits, no parity
	-ability to do BREAK detect (IRQ or output pin)
	-IRQ on character received

I'm using a Dallas DS2250 at 16 Mhz (8051 clone), but it won't do 
break detect.  I've looked at the 6850, 8251, 7201, 2661, etc...

	Any help would be appriciated!!!

I regard love as no more or less "benign" than any other Christian does.
You are merely expressing "approval" of the consequences I find therein.
Which says more about our politics and cultural trappings than about my
(or any) religion.  "Love" is a highly ambiguous word, of which Christians
can write both the "gentle" words Paul uses of it in 1 Corinthians -- in
a passage that even the "conservatives" will quote at you :-) -- and the
words of T. S. Eliot in his Pentacost Hymn, "Love is the unfamiliar Name
that wove the intolerable shirt of flame ..."

This is in any case rather to the side of what I was attempting to raise
in my note, as will become more evident below.

>As a non-believer, I find Michael's Christianity kinder and gentler.

blechhh.  I think you are misreading me, rather seriously.  Though,
given my principle that one CANNOT force one's own notion of "sin" on
another, and my unshakeable "disestablishmentarianism", Russel Turpin
and others (believers and unbelievers alike) are under no threat of my
legislating my own understanding of Christian love.

>If I take him at
>his word, he cannot condemn the Inquisitors, because they were
>also following these commandments as *they* understood them.  If

You misread.  I can do (and have repeatedly done) a complete bill of
accusation against the Inquisition by exhibiting in as thorough a form
as anyone might want a demonstration of the harm it has done to human
beings (in the first place) and to respect for (let alone love of) "God"
in near succession.  Please go back to my quoted words above:

The "possibility that always exists" is that I (or, to revert to proper
time sequence, my predecessors over the last several centuries) could
persuade "Christian B" of my case that the Inquisition *does* indeed
constitute an egregious violation of the Law of Love.  I must also note
that the majority of Christians HAVE been so persuaded.  By Christian
argumentation, as well as by secular [both Christian and non-Christian]
prohibitions.

What Mr. Turpin alludes to is a trickier point:

	A.  I demonstrate the human pain and violation of love involved
	    in the Inquisition.

	B.  The Inquisitor responds that Mother Church must, however
	    painful this *seems*, "discipline" her children for their
	    own good -- in this case the salvation of their souls (or
	    if the tortured heretic will not recant, than by bad example
	    "deterring" others from the same loss-of-soul.)

	A.  I point out that this "justification" of a failure in love
	    depends on a highly speculative construal of texts and of
	    philosophical assertions that are quite undemonstrable.

	B.  Burns me at the stake.

My rhetoric has failed, but the point I am making is sustained.  What is
going on here has a *lot* to do with "cultural baggage."  In this case,
the baggage includes a (nearly universal, and absolutely secular) belief
that an accused person must prove innocence and that testimony is most
believable if taken under torture.  The elimination of Inqisitorial
practice (in those places where it *has* been eliminated, or at least
greatly reduced) has very little, if anything, to do with the discussion
of sin in the exchange between A and B.

Mr. Turpin is pointing out that, if I am A versus the Grand Inquisitor's B,
then my persuasion is not very likely to work.  I know this; and in what-
ever personal agony, I consign the issue to God and my ghostly defense
attorney.  So, "one possibility" fails in this case -- as it will fail in
may others.  At the other extreme, the "persuasion" will succeed when it
properly SHOULD not, if it entails mistaken assumptions I share with the
Inquisitor.  And that is potentially an even more troubling case, in that
many of the victims of Inquisition will have "accepted" that they were in
fact sinful (in such random cases as they may actually have been guilty
of charges brought against them.)

The point is that the "persuasion" breaks down when the parties do NOT
share enough to agree on all the cultural baggage -- and given the main
thrust of the Inquisition, against "heresy", it is *bound* to break down
in precisely the "worst" cases.  The "conservative" (I don't think that
is the right word, BTW) will take refuge in what I attribute to B above,
that he is "justified" in causing harm because he *thinks* that works to
a "greater good."  But this is a violent and extravagant REFUSAL to follow
the gospel, as if one's theories about "sin" entitled one to cast aside
Jesus' words on dealing with sinners (cf. Matthew 5:39ff).

I am a "radical" Christian *only* in that I take the gospel seriously.

>(Or, for that matter, what does it mean to love one's fellow
>man?) And what is the "right thing"?  And how does one go about
>loving god? 

Well, the whole *point* of making these the "base" commandments is that
they *aren't* reducible to rules.  A set of rules is a moral code or a
law code or an algorithm for acting.  Such things can be very helpful
to individuals or societies -- but not if they are used *instead* of a
personal involvement in and responsibility for one's actions.  The Great
Commandment is, more than anything else, a call to act *as if you were
God and accepting ultimate responsibility* in your every action.  A
demand that I, like most, would rather *not* hear, but it keeps popping
up nonetheless (along with the reassurance that it is more important
that I be open to trying this, than succeeding at it).  "Conservatives"
may twist this "act as if you were God" to mean "lay down rules for other
people and be as nasty to them as possible if they don't keep YOUR rules."
They are so insistent (and obvious) about this that they have convinced a
lot of people (who rightly reject the whole concept!) that such idiocy
IS how God acts.  That, after all, is the standard accusation "against
God" by the atheists here and elsewhere.  That the "conservatives" have
confused THEIR manipulative, hoop-jumping notions of coercing other
people with the Nature of God is almost the entire content of standard
American atheism -- and I quite agree with it on this point.

>Ethical systems are not differentiated by the nice sounding goo
>up front, much of which sounds pretty much the same, but by the
>*specific* acts, procedures, and arguments that they recommend.

And different bodies of Christians have, from the beginning, urged
*different* "ethical systems" (or in some cases, none).  As a result,
it is bizarre to identify any one of these systems, however popular
(or infamous) with Christianity.  Christianity DOES NOT HAVE A TORAH.
It does not have a QU'RAN.  Specifically Christian scripture has very
little, if anything, in the way of "commandments" -- so little that
the "Christians" who desperately *want* commandments go "mining" for
them with almost no support (and thus almost no obvious limitation :-))
for their efforts.  The one, single, thing in the gospels which Jesus
specifically "gives" as "a commandment" to us is "love one another."

	[I will be expanding on this point in a reply to Paul Hudson
	 that I hope to get to in a day or so -- it is quite true that
	 SOME Christians infer LOTS of commandments from the NT; I'll
	 point out what has to be going on in these inferences, and why
	 there is a huge amount of "cultural baggage" involved.]

You are quite right that this is "goo" if one is looking for an ethical
system.

But why should anyone BE looking for an ethical system, since our
society is eager to hand us one or more no matter what we do?  It
may be that we need a principle for the CRITIQUE of ethical systems
-- in which case I will profer the _agapate allelou_ once again.

>I am glad that a few Christians,
>such as Michael, find a benign meaning for the goo, and then
>interpret the usually ugly specifics in a more constructive
>fashion.  On the other hand, I do think that this tells us more
>about Michael and Christians like him that it tells us about
>Christianity. 

I think you are begging the question. Why don't I and the (myriads
of) other Christians like me tell you something about Christianity?
[Nor is this very new in Christianity -- you might want to look up
the origins and fundamental doctrines of the Quakers, from the 17th
century onwards, and they are not at all the first to understand the
gospel in a manner that is congenial to my case.]

Anyone can expand the economy by chargeing $3 trillion on their credit

have MUCH preferred that the taxpayers had that $3 trillion instead.

If Reagan had kept his campaign PROMISE to balance the budget by 1983,
there would have been no need for Bush or Clinton to raise taxes.  And
all Reagan had to do was balance that puny Carter deficit.

Chew on that awhile.

NASA Headquarters distributed the following press
release today (4/6). I've typed it in verbatim, for you
folks to chew over. Many of the topics recently
discussed on sci.space are covered in this.

Gibbons Outlines Space Station Redesign Guidance

Dr. John H. Gibbons, Director, Office of Science and
Technology Policy, outlined to the members-designate of
the Advisory Committee on the Redesign of the Space
Station on April 3, three budget options as guidance to
the committee in their deliberations on the redesign of
the space station.

A low option of $5 billion, a mid-range option of $7
billion and a high option of $9 billion will be
considered by the committee. Each option would cover
the total expenditures for space station from fiscal
year 1994 through 1998 and would include funds for
development, operations, utilization, Shuttle
integration, facilities, research operations support,
transition cost and also must include adequate program
reserves to insure program implementation within the
available funds.

Over the next 5 years, $4 billion is reserved within
the NASA budget for the President's new technology
investment. As a result, station options above $7
billion must be accompanied by offsetting reductions in
the rest of the NASA budget.  For example, a space
station option of $9 billion would require $2 billion
in offsets from the NASA budget over the next 5 years.

Gibbons presented the information at an organizational
session of the advisory committee. Generally, the
members-designate focused upon administrative topics
and used the session to get acquainted. They also
received a legal and ethics briefing and an orientation
on the process the Station Redesign Team is following
to develop options for the advisory committee to
consider.

Gibbons also announced that the United States and its
international partners -- the Europeans, Japanese, and
Canadians -- have decided, after consultation, to give
"full consideration" to use of Russian assets in the
course of the space station redesign process.

To that end, the Russians will be asked to participate
in the redesign effort on an as-needed consulting
basis, so that the redesign team can make use of their
expertise in assessing the capabilities of MIR and the
possible use of MIR and other Russian capabilities and
systems. The U.S. and international partners hope to
benefit from the expertise of the Russian participants
in assessing Russian systems and technology. The
overall goal of the redesign effort is to develop
options for reducing station costs while preserving key
research and exploration capabilities. Careful
integration of Russian assets could be a key factor in
achieving that goal.

Gibbons reiterated that, "President Clinton is
committed to the redesigned space station and to making
every effort to preserve the science, the technology
and the jobs that the space station program represents.
However, he also is committed to a space station that
is well managed and one that does not consume the
national resources which should be used to invest in
the future of this industry and this nation."

NASA Administrator Daniel S. Goldin said the Russian
participation will be accomplished through the East-
West Space Science Center at the University of Maryland
under the leadership of Roald Sagdeev.

If no-one looks at the results, or acknowledges their correctness, in what
meaningful sense can the chip be said to "work"?? Does flibozity exist?
By "flibozity", I mean a particular, extremely complex configuration of 
physical phenomena, which no-one, absolutely NO-ONE cares about in the 
slightest. Does it exist, Eric?

Getting back to the question of whether the DES chip "works", doesn't "work" 
mean something like "achieving the desired/expected effect"? Note the way 
intentionality subtly underlies that definition. Even if we take the 
definition as "expected", instead of "desired", can you deny that conformance 
to expectations is itself a value of sorts, namely the scientific values of 
accuracy-of-prediction and reproducibility-of-results?

The phenomenologist Husserl, for one, considered Intentionality to be the
primary ontological "stuff" from which all other ontology was built --
perceptions, consciousness, thoughts, etc. Frank is by no means alone in
seeing intentionality (or "values", as he puts it) underlying all human
experience, even the so-called "objective" experiences, such as 
measurements of the natural world, or the output of your DES chip.

When are we going to hear a Christian answer to this question? 

In paraphrase: 

On what or whose authority do Christians proclaim that they
are above the Law and above the Prophets (7 major and 12 minor) and not 
accountable to the Ten Commandments of which Jesus clearly spoke His opinion 
in Matthew 5:14-19? What is the source of this pseudo-doctrine? Who is
the pseudo-teacher? Who is the Great Deceiver?

Evidence given for her prostitute status, besides the admittedly 
questionable claim of the man on trial included:

1. Prior employment in a number of massage parlors, with women who
claimed that she worked as a prostitute;

2. Walking around a truck stop at 4:00 AM wearing a lace miniskirt,
a halter top, and no underwear of any sort;

3. Not having a purse or other I.D. with her.

Not enough to convict her, but enough to create reasonable doubt
whether a rape actually took place, or theft of services.

Are you just ignorant, or lying again?

The accounts on the evening news indicated that they claimed self-

I get it.  One organization wants to abolish age of consent laws,
whereas in contrast the other wants to abolish age of consent laws.
This makes it respectable to belong to one organization, but not the

COMET (Commercial Experiment Transport) is to launch from Wallops Island
Virginia and orbit Earth for about 30 days. It is scheduled to come down
in the Utah Test & Training Range, west of Salt Lake City, Utah. I saw
a message in this group toward the end of March that it was to launch 
on March 27. Does anyone know if it launched on that day, or if not, 
when it is scheduled to launch and/or when it will come down.

I would also be interested in what kind(s) of payload(s) are onboard.

Thanks for your help.

I have attached a copy of an announcement I picked up during my trip to
Moscow last week.  I have several friends at the Moscow Aviation
Institute who have asked me to post this announcement.  (I have done
some editing, but the contents is unchanged from the original
announcement.) 

For those of you not familiar with the Moscow Aviation Institute, it is
the leading Russian school of higher education dedicated to the training
of aircraft and spacecraft designers.  It specializes in airframe
design, powerplant design, control systems, and power systems.
Virtually all of the major former Soviet airframe designers (Tupolev,
Su, Iluchine, Migoyan, etc.) were schooled at MAI.

I had the opportunity to tour the two museums that are maintained at
MAI.  The aircraft include Mig23, Su 27, Yak 38, the cockpit of an
F-111(!), among others.  It was a fascinating and eye opening
experience, expecially given the fact that the museum was, until a year
or so ago, closed to virtually everyone.  I also had the opportunity to
see some of the experiments being conducted with plasma drive engines
for future space craft use.

If you have any questions about the Institute, or the program, I would
be glad to try and answer them.  The institute, and most of it's faculty
have e-mail addresses.  However, it takes about a day or so for the
receiver to get the message.  They are still a bit antiquated - but they
are rapidly changing!

		MOSCOW INTERNATIONAL AVIATION SCHOOL

The aviation school "Poljot" (meaning Flight) is organized by the the
Moscow Aviation Institute, the prominent Russian Center of airspace
education and the foreign trade firm Poljot, well known in various
parts of the world for their quartz and mechanical wrist watches.

The course of studies will last only 50 days, but during this time
you will have the unique opportunity:
	- to listen to intensive courses on the main aviation

1)  Output offset:  Obtain the service manual for the oscilloscope
and adjust the internal output offset contorl.  There is virtual
certainty that there is an internal ajustment for the offset
control's zero detent position.

2)  Verify that the function generator is properly loaded.  Many
generators expect you to supply a 50 ohm load.  Go to a hamfest
flea market and scrounge around for a pass-through 50 ohm
terminator that has a male and female BNC (or whatever) connector
on it.  The calibrator on my Tektronix scope is designed to put out
.4v into a 1 meg load, but .1 volt into a 50 ohm load.  You may
also find that loading the output of the function generator also
reduces the harmonic distortion.

Build an attenuator.  You don't have to use (and I wouldn't want to
use) the input impedance of the device under test as part of the
voltage divider to drop the input test voltage.  Consider this:

------10K--------+---------? ohm ----
                 |
Gen            50 ohm            D.U.T.
(loaded)         |
-----------------+-------------------

Think about the ratio of 50/10K and then think about the accuracy
to which you can read voltages on your oscilloscope.  You can
virtually discount the loading of the D.U.T.  Also you have the
millivolt test generator you want.

Good luck,

Etc, unfortunately you can't pin this on the left or the right, both are
to blame. Both sides are equally deep into the corruption scandal. The only

separatists and the communist party which has collapsed.

Ed should take a look at the budget deficit Regan and Bush created together
before he starts to make claims about europe collapsing based on the budget
deficits here. None of them are serious on the USA scale.

And here in Europe we have zero interest in Ed-Ipser type freed thank you.
We do not want our countries to be run by a narrow elite of rich lawyers
for the benefit of the super wealthy. We are quite happy with social 
democracy and despite the fuss made in Time and Newsweek there is remarkably
little being done to reverse the social welfare reforms brought in by
socialism.

The problem with socialism is that it started with the aims of free education
and health care and provision of the welfare state. This has been achieved
across the whole of Europe, only the USA is struggling to catch up. The
problem for socialism is what to do now it has succeeded.

Rather the opposite. What is happening in Italy is that the communist party
has collapsed. This has meant that the grand coalition between right and
left wing parties to keep out the communists has also collapsed. The 
magistrates have seized this opportunity to crack down hard on fraud and 
corruption and have arrested half the politicians. The fact that the socialists
are in charge this week is incidental, the right is into the corruption just
as baddly.

What looks likely to happen is the fringe parties are going to do much
better in the next election. Most of the parliamentary deputies are going
to get replaced and the parties are going to be forced to look to people
who are free of any hint of corruption. Look out for a parliament of
Pavarotti's and porn stars.

There is a confusion here about what "bodily resources" constitutes.  Blood
transfusions and organ donations involve bodily resources; your examples
do not.

Is it not the case that, in the eyes of the law, when someone is aware of
something and has the capability of taking action and does not, that individual
may be held responsible for that action?

Example: the driver of a getaway car may be held as an accomplice to murder.
	 The "I didn't know" defense spawned the "ignorance of the law is no excuse"

When an individual is held as a material witness to a crime, is there a criminal
charge against the individual?  If not, on what grounds is the person imprisoned?

Unfortunately, things have been boding ill (is that a legitimate conjugation?)

You mean like: seconds, minutes, hours, days, months, years. . .  :-)

Remember,  the Fahrenheit temperature scale is also a centigrade scale.  Some
revisionists tell the history something like this:  The coldest point in a
particular Russian winter was marked on the thermometer as was the body
temperature of a volunteer (turns out he was sick, but you can't win 'em all).
Then the space in between the marks on the thermometer was then divided into
hundredths.

Here's something I posted about this a few years ago.  It's not fully
up to date with all the new variations (some of which are just different
manufacturer's synonyms):

------
In practical terms, ignoring the technological details, this is my view
of the families (NB I am not a giant corporation, which influences my
views on things like availability and backward compatibility):

74	The original.  Speed good, power consumption fair.  Effectively
	obsolete now; use 74LS or later, except for a *very* few oddball
	functions like 7407 which are hard to find in newer families.

74H	Modification of 74 for higher speed, at the cost of higher
	power consumption.  Very obsolete; use 74F.

74L	Modification of 74 for lower power, at the cost of lower speed.
	Very obsolete; use CMOS.

74S	Later modification of 74 for even higher speed, at some cost in
	power consumption.  Effectively obsolete; use 74F.

74LS	Combination of 74L and 74S, for speed comparable to 74 with lower
	power consumption.  Best all-round TTL now, widest variety of
	devices.

74F	Fast as blazes, power not too bad.  The clear choice for high
	speed in TTL.  Availability and prices generally good.

74AS	Failed competitor to 74F, although a few 74AS parts do things
	that are hard to find in 74F and thus are still useful.

74ALS	Possible replacement for 74LS.  Generally souped up.  Still fairly
	new, availability and prices possibly a problem.

74C	Fairly old family, CMOS devices with TTL pinouts.  Competed with
	4000 series, not too successfully.  Obsolete; use 4000 or newer
	CMOS 74 families.

4000	(Thrown in as the major non-74 non-ECL logic family.)  The old CMOS
	family, still viable because of *very* wide range of devices, low
	power consumption, and wide range of supply voltages.  Not fast.
	Very forgiving and easy to work with (beware static electricity,
	but that comment applies to many other modern logic families too).
	There are neat devices in this family that exist in no other.  The
	clear choice when speed is not important.

74HC	A new attempt at 74-pinout CMOS.  Fast compared to old CMOS, power
	consumption often lower than TTL.  Possibly a good choice for
	general-purpose logic, assuming availability and affordability.
	CMOS logic levels, *not* TTL ones.  Beware very limited range of
	supply voltages compared to older CMOS, also major rise of power
	consumption at faster speeds.

74HCT	74HC with TTL logic levels.  Much the same comments as 74HC.  Read
	the fine print on things like power consumption -- TTL compatibility
	in CMOS involves some compromises.

10K	(Thrown in for speed freaks.)  The low end of ECL.  Various sources
	claim that it is *easier* to work with than super-fast TTL for
	serious high-speed work.  Less forgiving, though:  read and follow
	the rules or it won't work.  Availability to hobbyists limited,
	can be expensive.

100K	(For real speed freaks.)  Hot ECL.  Harder to handle than 10K, and
	inconvenient packages.  Much more useful datasheets, however.

As for compatibility between families:  the 74 families (except 74C and
74HC) are all more or less logic-level compatible, but how many 74X devices
you can drive from one 74Y output varies enormously with X and Y.  You just
have to read the specs and do the arithmetic.  74C and 74HC are compatible
with the others with a bit of hassle.  4000 compatibility can be a bit of
hassle or a lot of hassle depending on what supply voltage 4000 is using.
10K or 100K to anything else is considerable hassle.

Me?  I use 4000 and 74LS with a sprinkling of 74F.  74HC[T] and 10K are
interesting but I haven't used either significantly yet.

I think that you are changing the meaning of "values" here. Perhaps
it is time to backtrack and take a look at the word.

value n. 1. A fair equivalent or return for something, such as goods
or service. 2. Monetary or material worth. 3. Worth as measured in 
usefulness or importance; merit. 4. A principle, standard, or quality
considered inherently worthwhile or desirable. 5. Precise meaning, as
of a word. 6. An assigned or calculated numerical quantity. 7. Mus. 
The relative duratation of a tone or rest. 8. The relative darkness or
lightness of a color. 9. The distinctive quality of a speech or speech
sound. 

In context of a moral system, definition four seems to fit best. In terms
of scientific usage, definitions six or eight might apply. Note that
these definitions do not mean the same thing.

In my mind, to say that science has its basis in values is a bit of a
reach. Science has its basis in observable fact. Even the usages of the
word "value" above do not denote observable fact, but rather a standard
of measurement. I would conclude that science does not have its
basis in values, and so your statement above fails. In fact, if one
concludes that a scientific set of measurements (values) are based on
systems derived from observation, then it must follow that in a
scientific context, there is no such thing as there is no such thing as
"objective values."

Back to the present. This has nothing to do with a moral system anyhow.
Just because the word "values" is used in both contexts does not mean
that there is a relationship between the two contexts.

If one is to argue for objective values (in a moral sense) then one must
first start by demonstrating that morality itself is objective. Considering
the meaning of the word "objective" I doubt that this will ever happen.

So, back to the original question:

And objective morality is.....?

If you can provide an objective foundation for "morality" then that will
be a good beginning.

  This may sound like a simple-minded question, but this is the first time
I've ever had a need for this:

I've been designing some relatively simple chip circuits based on things
like photoresistors (you know, no light to photoresistor, emit a logic
high, etc.).

Anyway, I've got some servos lying around, and I wanted to do some things
with them using digital logic.  I know all about having to pulse the signal
and everything, I just have one problem:  I'm assuming I need a negative
(yes, negative) logic high to get the thing to turn in the direction 
opposite the direction it would turn under normal logic high.

Is a negative logic high (I've seen this in schematics) the same thing as
an active low, or what?  I'm not using a bi-polar power source, so how
would I get a negative logic high out of this thing?  I need to have all
three signals available:  Logic high, logic low, and negative logic high.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Also, please reply via email, as I
never seem to have time to read this (or any other) group lately.

Thanks much,

	You misunderstand.  I'm not trying to prove a *cause* for anything. 
Merely pointing out that Ted's assertion that the "blip" in revenues was
"caused" by selling to avoid the tax can't be proven.

	It works for any situation.  If you believe the market is going up,
don't sell.

	If believe it's not, sell.  But then you'd be selling anyways, wouldn't
you?

	So where is the evidence that a large number of people suddenly decided
that the higher taxes meant they should sell before the year was out?

	There isn't any.

	Ted's saying that the increase over the previous year is "proof" of
that proposition, but I'm saying you can't know that the trend of increasing

Who mentioned dirtbikes? We're talking highway speeds here. If you go 70mph
on your dirtbike then feel free to contribute.

Because it wouldn't be a Jeep if it didn't. A friend of mine just bought one
and it has more warning stickers than those little 4-wheelers (I guess that's
becuase it's a big 4 wheeler). Anyway, it's written in about ten places that
the windshield should remain up at all times, and it looks like they've made
it a pain to put it down anyway, from what he says. To be fair, I do admit
that it would be a similar matter to drive a windscreenless Jeep on the 
highway as for bikers. They may participate in this discussion, but they're
probably few and far between, so I maintain that this topic is of interest
primarily to bikers.

Notice how Ed picked on the more insignificant (the lower case part) of the 
two parts of the statement. Besides, around here it is quite rare to see 
bikers wear goggles on the street. It's either full face with shield, or 
open face with either nothing or aviator sunglasses. My experience of 
bicycling with contact lenses and sunglasses says that non-wraparound 
sunglasses do almost nothing to keep the crap out of ones eyes.

Ok, ok, fine, whatever you say, but lets make some attmept to stick to the
point. I've been out on the road where I had to stop every half hour to clean
my shield there were so many bugs (and my jacket would be a blood-splattered
mess) and I'd see guys with shorty helmets, NO GOGGLES, long beards and tight
t-shirts merrily cruising along on bikes with no windscreens. Lets be really
specific this time, so that even Ed understands. Does anbody think that 
splattering bugs with one's face is fun, or are there other reasons to do it?
Image? Laziness? To make a point about freedom of bug splattering?

Compare the Driver to an urge such as Jealousy, where there is an urge
and an "object". The jealousy does not technically exist until the object
is apparent. However, the capacity to be jealous is presumably still there
even though it is not detectable.

Your description of the Unbilical took me three passes to understand (!) but
I get the gist and I have to tentatively agree. I think our two definitions
can sit side by side without too much trouble, though. I haven't attempted to
define the reason behind the Moral Driver (only hinted through the essence of
each Moral). Your definition hints that animals are also capable of a
similar morality - Simians have a similar Social Order to ourselves and it is
easy to anthropomorphize with these animals. Is this possible or have I
misunderstood?

My p.s. thoughts falls roughly in line with John Stuart Mill and
his writings on Utilitarianism. I have no particular plan (except to do
my bit - personal ethics AND social work). My opinion (for what it is worth)
is that the Authority for each Moral must be increased somehow, and that this
will probably take several generations to be effective. I don't think that the
list of Morals has changed for Society significantly, though . The Authority element
may come from our authority figures and roles models (see Eric Berne and his
transactional analysis work [+ Mavis Klein] for references) and this is what
gives rise to a deterioration of moral standards in the long term.

I've had some more thoughts on my definitions:

I've was thinking that I should add Moral Character to the list of definitions
in order to get a dynamic version of the Moral Nature (ie. the interplay of
the Moral Code and associated Authorities). A suitable analogy might be a
graphic equaliser on a HiFi system - the Moral Nature being the set of
frequencies and the chosen 'amplitudes', and the Moral Character being the
spectrum over time.

Conscience is a little more difficult because I can't define it as the
reasoning of a person between actions in the context of his Moral Nature
because Conscience seems to cut in most of the time unbidden and often
unwanted. I think Conscience is manifest when a decision is made at a given
time which compromises one's Moral Nature. My Conscience fits in more with
Freud's SuperEgo (plus the Moral Driver) with the stimulous being the
urges or Freud's Id. The reasoning that I mentioned before is Freud's Ego,
I suppose. If the Moral Driver is part of the Id then the reason why
Conscience cuts in unbidden is partially explained. The question is "what
provides the stimulous to activate the Moral driver?". I think I need some
more time with this one.

That's about it for now!

Here in switzerland, the situation is exactly the same. The cable tv companies  
even tried to stop amateur radio in switzerland in the beginning of cable  
tv(they seem to be too stupid to know anything about international frequency  
conferences or so). Even today, they use the cheapest possible coax running  
into problems they can't solve anymore. As Bill noted, the only way is to look  
for a solution with the neighbours *BEFORE* calling for the cable tv guys or  
the fcc. The chance to find neighbours with some sense for reason is by far  
bigger than with these people (especially the first ones). As anywhere in an  
administration people don't like, if You tell them to work for the money they  
get...
The problem is, that radio amateurs don't have the power to put trough their  
rights in all cases. So let's hope they start soon with optical fibers and get  
out of our freqencies.

	************************************************************


Let me begin by saying I think this is the world's first religion to use
the net as its major recruitment medium.  Therefore, even if this
religion does not take off, its founding members will be very important
historically as this method of soliciting membership will eventually become 
common.

The basis of this religion is to apply various aspects of current conventional
morality to the characters in Genesis and Exodus but assume that the Bible's
accounts of the facts and historical events is correct.

For example,

Story of Adam and Eve:
Adam and Eve are in Garden of Eden naked and ignorant.  Have unlimited
supply of food provided, but no clothing, jobs, or knowledge.  God says
not to eat fruit of tree of knowledge.  They do anyway, then try to hide 
in bushes.  God finds them and forces them out of Garden.
(There are several different stories on what they were doing while naked in
the bushes that might have angered God.)

Traditional Philosophy:
1. The only reason you need knowledge or a job is to eat.  If someone else will
provide you with food, then you can be stupid and unemployed and it's OK. This
is why married women usually didn't work until recent decades.
2. Authority figures, such as God, whoever was behind the Vietnam War, Hitler 
and slaveowners, are always right and should be blindly followed without 
question by ordinary people, who can't make decisions for themselves.

Interpretation of events based on Traditional Philosophy:
They were not supposed to eat the fruit.  They should have done whatever God
told them to.  Like small children, they had their needs provided for and were
obligated to do whatever their "Father" said to.  Being forced to leave the 
Garden and work in order to obtain food was a punishment.

Lessons from Traditional Interpretation:
1.  Ignorance is good.  Knowledge is bad, but tempting.
2.  Having food provided for you for nothing (read "welfare") is ideal.  Get-
ting a job and feeding yourself with what you earn is punishment.
3.  Public nudity is good.  Covering up is bad.
4.  Authority figures are intrinsically right.  Normal people are dumb and 
should do whatever they are told without question.  They should not think for 
themselves.
5.  People in subordinate positions are especially obligated to refrain from
learning.  For example, it should be illegal for slaves to learn to read.

1990's philosophy:
1.  People should seek education and employment outside the home, unless
named "Hillary Clinton" or "Murphy Brown".
2.  People should use common sense.  They should not kill other people 
(binding of Issac, wars, Holocaust, etc.) just because they are told to.

Interpretation of events based on current philosophy:
They were supposed to eat the fruit.  God gave wanted them to seek knowledge
rather than be handed it on a silver platter.  Once they had gained knowledge
and (by seeking it) showed their ability to make mature decisions for them-
selves, they no longer needed to be treated like little children and were 
REWARDED by being allowed into the "real world."

Lessons from new interpretation:
1.  Ignorance is bad.  Knowledge is good, but must be sought.
2.  Having food provided for you for nothing (read "welfare") is at best
a temporary measure.  Getting a job and feeding yourself with what you earn
is ideal.
3.  Public nudity is bad.  Covering up is good.
4.  Authority figures are often wrong.  Normal people are intelligent and
should consider whether the instructions are really a good idea and "alter
or abolish" bad governments.  They should think for themselves.
5.  People in subordinate decisions are often discouraged from knowledge
but should seek it anyway, and all the harder.  For example, poor children 
without good schools should work especially hard in order to make a better
life for their children (and themselves).

I have tentatively named this new philosophy "The Church of Eveism" because
Eve's decision to eat the apple is man[sic]kind's first good decision, instead
of its first bad one, as traditionally believed.  She is therefore clearly
a protagonist.  God at first appears evil, for telling people not to seek 
knowledge but on deeper analysis is also a protagonist.  As God rewarded the
decision to defy him, and provided the tree in the first place, the intention
and desire were clearly to have the knowledge be obtained, but to delay it 
until it was actively sought.

Bob is indeed correct here in more than one way. A look in the old
RCA picture tube manual backs this up, as does SAMS Reference Data
handbook. The internal coating around the perimeter of the CRT
(not the aluminum or tin CRT face coating) is referred to as a
"dag" as well as the outer coating.

Thankfully, I didn't need to go to a f****** library to find it, either.

My experience is that the CD drawer becomes a bit loose, and the CD either skips
or can't be read.  Try seeing if all the screws that hold down the drawer
assembly are tightened properly.  Other than that, my next guess would be one of
the motors.  Hope this helps.

The best info I have seen so far is the article "Joystick Metrics:
Measuring physical properties through the PC's joystick port" by
Michael Covington in the May 1985 issue of PC Tech Journal.  It talks
about how to read all kinds of things (voltage, current, resistance) in
BASIC, and even includes code for a simple "oscilloscope" display.

It's possible to read the joystick port directly if you don't want to
use BASIC.  The detailed information for this is in the PC Technical
Reference under Options and Adapters.  You have to provide some
millisecond resolution timing functions, but that's a subject which has
appeared many times in articles from Dr. Dobb's, Circuit Cellar Ink,
etc.  Look for the public domain ztimer package on wuarchive.

Given my desire to stay as far away as possible from farming and ranching

but I really hate it.

Ed, exactly what kind of mutant horse-like entity do you ride, anyway?
Does countersteering work on the normal, garden-variety, one-necked horse?

Obmoto:  I was flipping through the March (I think) issue of Rider, and I
saw a small pseudo-ad for a book on hand signals appropriate to motorcycling.
It mentioned something about a signal for "Your passenger is on fire."  Any
body know the title and author of this book, and where I could get a copy?
This should not be understood as implying that I have grown sociable enough
to ride with anyone, but the book sounded cute.

I see we are dealing with a problem in a conflict of interpretations, not
least of which is your belief that only you can adequately judge what is
and is not debate.  Suffice to say that I disagree with you on that last
point.  Why don't you take a poll, Fred, if you want some psuedo-objective
point-of-view?

And, as usual, you defend your insults with "he started it."  "Yeah, I
took some of his research and called it my own, but he started it."  "So
what if I stole his car, he stole my lawnmower first."  Besides that, I
think it's still open to interpretation whether Nick actually did start it.
So your defense, besides being lame, and contradicting the first part of
the sentence in which it occurs, may not even apply anyway.

Your defense reminds me of the guy that broke the borrowed tool:  "I
never borrowed it, I already gave it back, and it was broken when you
gave it to me."  Make up yer mind, Fred!

can I, Fred?  You've got a great point here somewhere, it's just that
between stupid people that you must insult, and your jealous guarding of
your valuable opinions, you never actually get around to making it.

*** Fred issue #2;  Nick's alleged meaning ***

Too bad the plan only exists in your mind, instead of Nick's, or you
would have a really good point.  Instead you have provided a good reason
to ignore your insults, since they are based on incorrect interpretations
that you have made about others.  Forgive me for giving your insults more
meaning than they ever should have had.

My reading of what Nick actually said is that "people aren't required in
all parts of all space processes", so your taking issue with his opinions
regarding people in the space program, I read as "People are required in
all parts of all space processes."  So, help me out, here, Fred, since I'm
so patently stupid.  Did you read Nick wrong?  Or are you going to eat
your terminal now?  If the latter, I sure hope it's one of those Cheeto and
string models that all the computer mags have been raving about :-)

The point is, _I_ am not stupid because of _your_ incorrect assumption.  I'd
only be stupid if I insulted you for having made it.  But, alas, that's your
job, Fred.

And, finally, your style is confusing, since you tried to make two points,
simultaneously, with an allegory/insult.  Sadly, one point addressed a 'plan'
that only existed in your mind, and the other took issue with behaviors that
you do as much as anyone.

>More deliberate lack of understanding, Tommy?

No, no, I finally got it.  You don't like the plan that Nick's posts made
you imagine.  And you don't like Nick's obnoxious behavior, even though
it's no worse than your own.  Thanks for taking the time with someone as
dense as myself.

Who cares who came on the net first?  If you do, consider that you saw
me come on after a brief haitus, before which I was on for about 2 years.
If you had seen me on the net first, you'd remember when Nick and I went
down exactly the same road regarding rude, unneccesary behavior.  It's
just amazing to me that you continue to take issue with behavior that's
no worse than your own.

Let's see here, my complaints about your obnoxious behavior are hypocritical,
while your flames against people you decide are flamers isn't, and my
complaints about your name-calling are immature, while your name-calling
isn't.  Yeah, right.  Maybe if you called me some more names, I might
see it better, Fred.

"Net.ghod wannabe"?  Naturally, Fred, you've correctly interpreted my
motivations, when yours are impossible to judge from your actions (as
your insulting of people that try, proves).  I didn't really care about
people that fill the net with personal garbage, what I really wanted was to
impress everyone.  I only put my complaints with your behavior on private
mail, not because it belongs there, but because I thought you were such a
jerk that you'd bring it back to the Net, playing right into my hands.
Alas, I had no idea what an intellectual master you were, turning tables and
bringing the history of these posts to the net, for the noble and valuable
purpose of embarassing me.  Whether I should feel stupid because I tried
to make suggestions to such a superior intellect, or becuase I tried to
communicate like an adult with a self-righteous ass, still isn't clear.

Well, Fred, you exposed me.  Now I'll never be able to get a(nother) job
with NASA, since they all know that I'm stupider than Fred McCall.  Well,
I just hope you're happy.  Please leave me alone, now.  I just don't
have the heart to attempt keeping up with one so far above me.  Maybe Nick
or Pat can approach your high standards, but I'm dropping it now.

For those missing the context of this thrilling discussion between
Jim and I, Jim wrote the following to me in e-mail after I pointed out
that he (Jim) had taken a quote out of context:
>In t.r.m. Robert Weiss writes [a promise from Psalm 9:10]
>Gee, since you wouldn't be at all hypocritical, you must be really
>busy arguing against these out-of-context extracted translations!

He directed a similar accusation of hypocrisy, again based on a lack of
response to an article by Robert Weiss, toward Stephen.

I pointed out that I did, in fact, agree that both Robert Weiss and
Jim Meritt took quotes out of context.  Hence, I find it difficult to
understand why Jim thinks I am a hypocrite.  Needless to say, I don't
have time to reply to *every* article on t.r.m. that takes a quote
out of context.  

I asked Jim the following:
>}So, according to you, Jim, the only way to criticize one person for
>}taking a quote out of context, without being a hypocrite, is to post a
>}response to *every* person on t.r.m who takes a quote out of context?

Jim replied by saying 
>Did I either ask or assert that?

But today we find four articles from Jim, one of which has the subject
"Silence is concurrence":  

m23364@mwunix.mitre.org (James Meritt) writes:
>Is it not the case that, in the eyes of the law, when someone is aware of
>something and has the capability of taking action and does not, that individual
>may be held responsible for that action?

Which is, of course, a complete red herring.  Taking quotes out of
context isn't a crime.  I don't have time to read every article on
t.r.m., and I'm certainly under no obligation to reply to them all.

Does "silence is concurrence" imply that Jim thinks that because I
didn't respond to Weiss' articles I must condone Weiss' taking quotes
out of context?  Jim doesn't want to give a direct answer to this
question; read what he has written and decide for yourself.


But back to the context of my conversation with Jim.  Jim's next 
gambit was to claim that he was using inductive logic when he
concluded that I was being a hypocrite.  I challenged him to provide
the details of that logic that led him to an incorrect conclusion.
Today we find another obscure article (posting it twice didn't help
make it more clear, Jim), titled "Inductive Logic":

>Scenario:
>A white goose waddles past the door
>A white goose waddles past the door
>A white goose waddles past the door

>2. If ONLY black geese are observed to be axed, is it not a valid question 
>   to be concerned with the different behavior between black and white geese?

More red herrings.  Could Jim mean that he has read an uncountably large
number of my articles?  Could Jim mean that because I "axed" his articles,
but not Weiss' articles, he wants to conclude inductively ...
Well, I can't see where he is going with this.

But I can help him with his induction.  I've written roughly 80
articles since January.  The vast majority of them are discussions with
Frank DeCenso and other inerrantists, where I take the position that
they are making bad arguments.  Some are discussions with Jim Meritt
where I take the position that he is making bad arguments (a straw man
argument earlier, and taking quotes out of context more recently.)

Think hard about this Jim.  See the pattern?  Think harder.  Run it
through your induction engine and see what pops out.

The Command Loss Timer is part of the fault protection scheme of the
spacecraft.  If the Command Loss Timer ever countdowns to zero, then the
spacecraft assumes it has lost communications with Earth and will go 
through a set of predetermined steps to try to regain contact.  The
Command Loss Timer is set to 264 hours and reset about once a week during 
the cruise phase, and is set to a lower value during an encounter phase.

I've never seen a speedometer-reading model. Are you sure? Who makes

of cars in use... I've seen single beam moving-mode and split beam

But Allen, if you can assume the existence of an SSTO there is no need
to have the contest in the first place.  I would think that what we
want to get out of the contest is the development of some of these
'cheaper' ways of doing things; if they already exist, why flush $1G

As one of the "Clintonites" cited above, I'll try to clarify since this
is not a case of Clinton's "dishonesty." (I won't necessarily defend him
on other issues.)  

There were NEVER any specific projects included in the Community
Development Block Grant portion of the President's proposal.  Congressional
Republicans, in an effort to discredit the stimulus package, selected what
they felt were silly sounding projects from a wish-list of POTENTIAL 
projects prepared by the US Mayors' Conference before the stimulus package
was ever proposed.  (The document in question was designed to pressure the
White House to increase the size of the block grant proposal submitted
to Congress.  It didn't work.)

The $2.56(?) billion proposed in the stimulus package came nowhere close
to covering the total estimated cost of the original wish-list.  If it
were passed, communities would have to select which projects to fund and
at what level.

In the case of Spokane, Wa., Tom Foley's home district, no one ever
expected to be able to refurbish a local swimming pool (one of the 
Republicans' examples) FROM THE FUNDS AVAILABLE IN THE STIMULUS
PACKAGE since the estimated cost of doing so exceeded the total 
amount of block grant funds the city would receive from the stimulus 
package for ALL projects.  

The plan, instead, was to use the money on public housing construction
and remodeling to cope with a severe housing shortage.  (Yup, there are
places where that is true.)  The swimming pool improvements were near the
bottom of a long list of priorities prepared by the city.  The $3 million
or so to be received would cover only a few of the most pressing
priorities.

If the block grants are cut from the stimulus package, it is these projects
that will be affected by the lack of funds.  And that is why the Clinton
administration has been publicizing the issue.

A final point.  One may or may not like community block grants.  It is
worth noting, however, that Congressional Republicans' opposition to them
is new.  Since the Nixon administration, Republicans have generally 
supported such grants as an alternative to targeted federal spending,
arguing that local governments are far better able to determine spending
priorities than "Washington bureaucrats."  

Is it clear now?  Or is this all too complicated to understand?

Sorry, but it doesn't matter what _you_ think, I am a Christian, who happens to
belong to the LDS Church.  [The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints].

I don't usually read t.r.m.  It is truly informative to stop by, and see that there
are still people in the world like those that forced my ancestors into the deserts
of Utah, and then out of the country entirely.  (My grandmother was born in Mexico,
where her family had moved to escape religious persecution in the US).  I'm willing
to admit that members of other churches are Christians, if they believe in Christ and
(try to) follow his teachings, even though they have different interpretations of 
the bible.  And yet these other churches often go out of their way to define whether
or not I am considered to be Christian.  Could someone mail me a set of rules/beliefs
that must be followed to be a Christian?  Does this set of rules exclude other large
bodies of believers?  

I know, this is a waste of everyone's time, this has probably been discussed N times,
etc.  I guess I'm more sensitive to this 'demonization' after what went on in Texas.

Stop! Hold it! You have a few problems here. Official history says that 
the first accusations of homosexuality in the SA came from OUTSIDE of the Nazi 
party, long BEFORE the Nazis ever came to power. So this objection is a red
herring, even if established history is wrong on this point. Moreover, none of 
the histories I've read ever made mention of Hitler or anyone else ever using 
homosexuality as a pretext for purging Roehm. A point I saw reiterated was that
Hitler and the party covered up these accusations. If you are going to accuse
official history of being a fabrication, you should at least get your facts
right. The pretext for purging Roehm was that he was planning to use the SA in
a coup against Hitler. Nowhere is there mention of using allegations of
homosexuality as a pretext for the purge, nor as a justification afterwards (it
is possible that the histories I've read have not mentioned this, but I doubt
it - would it be in Hitler's best interest to admit to the world that his
former right hand man was a homosexual?). 

Anyway, as I said before, it is always possible that I have missed references 
to the Nazis making use of charges of homosexuality against the SA after the 
night of the long knives - but this does not prove that they were false. Even 
the Nazis could tell the truth when it was to their advantage. In any case, 
this does not deal with accusations of homosexuality in the SA during the 
1920's.

>Since the accusers thereafter controlled the records,
>anything bearing on the subject -- true or not -- has to be considered
>tainted evidence. 

Ah, yes. I forgot this was being posted to alt.conspiracy. I can smell the
paranoia from here. Since the Nazis never officially charged Roehm with 
homosexuality (at least, not according to what I've read), I'd like to know 
what tainted "evidence" you are talking about. Since the accusations were made 
by persons outside of the Nazi party, long before it came to power, and those 
accusations were common knowledge to journalists and others in Germany in the 
1920's and 30's, just how would it be possible for the Nazis to go back in 
time and plant "tainted" evidence? How exactly does one doctor newspapers 
which were circulated around the world, without the discrepancies being 
obvious? What actual incidences of Nazi doctoring evidence on this matter
do you know about? And what about the testimony of people who were involved in 
these matters, some of whom were not Nazis? And what is the point of making a 
false accusation of homosexuality if you do not publicize it? Since the point 
here seems to be to discredit established history, then the burden of proof 
falls on the revisionist. The revisionists had better do their homework 
before making accusations. Otherwise they simply look like conspiracy nuts.

>The available data suggest that Roehm and his crowd,

This is just about the *only* thing we agree on. 

I suspect that the notion that there might have been bad people - Roehm and 
his SA buddies - who were homosexuals must disturb some people. The feeling
seems to be that if a nasty individual is accused of homosexuality, that this
must be an attempt to bash homosexuals. This fear - often justified - is what
lies behind this distrust of official history, or so it seems to me. But this
is not a good justification for trashing accepted accounts of this subject. If 
you really think that historians are so incompetent, why don't you write them 
and ask where they got their sources on this subject, if you can't tell from 
their footnotes? I'm a graduate student in history. Writing to professors and
tracking down sources is old hat. But my time is limited and this is not my
specialty - and neither you nor anyone else have said anything that would
cast one shred of doubt on existing evidence. I'm not going to waste my time
trying to debunk someone's paranoia. Do the research yourself.

>but concrete particulars are still no more than

Given that you already consider all evidence "tainted", what on earth would
constitute concrete particulars? And since when have concrete particulars been
considered "shrewd guesses"?

I suggest that those who do not trust popular historians (Irving et al) -
historians writing for a popular audience do not, as a rule, provide copious 
footnotes - should try instead reading academic historians, who usually 
provide footnotes to all their sources in immmense detail. This is the place 
to start looking. Assuming that one really wants to know the truth.

I'll bet the folks on alt.pagan are tired of this subject already. My

Seems that the Mile-Long Billboard and any other inflateble space
object/station or what ever have the same problems. (other than being a little
bit different than the "normal" space ideas, such as trusses and shuttles)

But also dag and such.. Why not combine the discussion of how and fesibility to
the same topic?

I personnelly liek the idea of a billboard in space. But problem. How do you
service it? fly a shuttle/DC-1 to near it and then dismount and "fly" to it?
Or what?? or havign a special docking section for shuttle/DC-1 docking?

Also what if the billboard springs a leak? Self sealing and such??


Just thinking (okay rambling)..

Also why must the now inflated billboard, not be covered in the inside by a
harder substance (such as a polymer or other agent) and then the now "hard"
billboard would be a now giant docking structure/space dock/station??

Or am I missing something here.. (probably am!?)

Neil Gehrels is Prof. Tom Gehrels son.  Tom Gehrels was the discoverer
of P/Gehrels 3 (as well as about 4 other comets - the latest of which
does not bear his name, but rather the name "Spacewatch" since he was
observing with that system when he found the latest comet).

It may be "irrelevant" to you and *your* personal beliefs (or should I say

authority you do this?  Because "it says so in the Bible?"  --Does the
Bible "say so," or is it YOU, or someone else, who interprets whether a
scripture or doctrine conforms to your particular liking or "disapproval"?

Excuse moi, but your line of "truths" haven't moved me one bit to persuade
me that my beliefs are erroneous.  Of all the "preachers" of "truth" on
this net, you have struck me as a self-righteous member of the wrecking
crew, with no positive message to me or any other Latter-day Saint...
BTW, this entire discussion reminds me a lot of the things said by Jesus
to the pharisees: "ye hypocrite(s) . . . ye preach about me with your lips,
but your hearts are far removed from me..."

Sophistry.  Look who's talking: "jumping to conclusions?"  You wouldn't do
that yourself, right?  All YOU address is your own convictions, regardless
whether we come up with any Biblical scriptures which supports our points
of view, because you reject such interpretations without any consideration
whatsoever.

Correction: it may contradict would YOU think the Bible says.  The Bible
indeed does teach that not all are children of God in the sense that they
"belong to" or follow God in His footsteps.  Satan and his followers have
rebelled against God, and are not "children (=followers/redeemed) of God,"
but it doesn't mean that they were not once created by God, but chose to
separate themselves from those who chose to follow God and His plan of
salvation.

So?  --This illustrates nicely what I just said: the children of the

addressed in this and other verses you copied from your Bible.  You
purposefully obscured the subject by swamping your "right" with non-

In this single posting of yours, I've seen more "constructs of imagination"
than in all of the pro-lds mails combined I have read so far in this news
group.  First get your lds-facts straight before you dare preaching to us
about "the only true God," whom you interpret according to your own likes
and dislikes, but whose image I cannot reconcile with what I know about
Him myself.  I guess your grandiose self-image does not allow for other
faiths, believing in the divinity of Jesus Christ, but in a different
way or fashion than your own.  Not that it really matters, the mission
and progress of the lds church will go on, boldly and nobly, and no mob
or opponent can stop the work from progressing, until it has visited
every continent, swept every clime, and sounded in every ear.

Sigh.  "What the Bible teaches"?  Or: "what the bible teaches according to
Robert Weiss and co.?"  I respect the former, I reject the latter without
the remotest feeling that I have rejected Jesus.  On the contrary.  And by
the way, I do respect your interpretations of the Bible, I even grant you
being a Christian (following your own image of Him), as much as I am a
Christian (following my own image of Him in my heart).

The issue is, of course, that you love to use anything to either mis-

is obviously very important.  McConkie's views have been controversial
(e.g. "The Seven Deadly Heresies" has made me a heretic!  ;-) at best,
or erroneous at worst ("blacks not to receive the priesthood in this
dispensation").  I respect him as someone who has made his valuable
contribution to the church, but I personally do NOT rely on his personal
interpretations (his book "Mormon Doctrine" is oftentimes referred to
as "McConkie's Bible" in mormon circles) on mormon doctrine.  I rather
look to official (doctrinal) sources, and... to Hugh Nibley's books!
(The last comment is an lds-insider reference.)  Summarizing: McConkie
was a wise man who contributed undoubtedly far more to the kingdom of
God than I have, but whose views are by no means dogma or accepted
doctrine, some of it clearly belongs to personal interpretation and
speculation.  But having said this, I find McConkie (even in his most
biased and speculative moments) far more thought-provoking than the
trash coming from your proverbial pen.  I'm somewhat appalled that I have
allowed myself to sink as low as you in this posting...

OK Phil, you're right. So far the "evidence" suggests that Nixon was a victim
of overzealous underlings and Kennedy was a womanizing disgust-o-blob with
a dash of megalomania. After crushing the CIA and FBI who's to say Kennedy 
wouldn't have created his own version of American Friendly Fascism?

Unfortunately however, we don't have all the evidence. So far this nation's
citizens have been privy to about 12 hours of the total 4,000 hours of Nixon's
tapes. What's on the rest of those babies? Some archivists have alluded that
there is "evidence" to suggest that Nixon and his cronies, including George
Bush, were aware of the plot to murder Kennedy before he was shot in Dallas.

Ask your local D.A. what the charges are for the above crime.

	Would you please define "nth derivative of debt"?  Last time I asked

	And it's the deficits themselves that came down to 2.9% of GNP.  The

  What  evidence  indicates that Gamma Ray bursters are very far away?

Given the enormous  power,  i was just wondering,  what if they are
quantum  black holes or something  like that  fairly close by?

Why would they have to be at  galactic ranges?   

my own pet theory is that it's  Flying saucers  entering

but the reason i am asking is that most everyone assumes  that they
are  colliding nuetron stars  or  spinning black holes,  i just wondered
if any mechanism could exist  and place them  closer in.

Thought it means Global Positioning System. There are two precision levels, one  
for army applications (killing has to be very accurate today) and one for civil  
ones. The civil precision is about 20 to 30m (correct me, if I'm wrong),  
though, it may be insufficiant for mapping buildings. But there is a way with  
an additional reference point (e.g. one fixed GPS system in a house) to get the  
same high precision as the military version, but it gets pretty complicated  
then. If You use a microwave system (actually this means some type of radar),  
You need quite a lot of number crunching to get accurate vectorized data out of  
Your original signals. So the GPS system seems to be the better (and running)  
idea for Your application(there have been discussions in this newsgroup, don't  
know of an address anymore).

What kind of witnesses?  If we are talking about witnesses who were at
the accident, or were otherwise directly involved (e.g., paramedics,
emergency room doctors, etc.), then they should have been used at the
first trial.  You don't get a new trial because you screwed up and
forgot to call all of your witnesses.

If we are talking about new expert witnesses who will offer new
interpretations of the data, note that the loser can *ALWAYS* find
such witnesses.  If this were grounds for a new trial, then the loser
could *ALWAYS* get a new trial, and keep doing so until the loser
becomes a winner (and then the other side would come up with new
expert witnesses).

	Alan, you can start by teaching your children that the perpetrators
of crimes no more represent the "Black community" than racist hateful Whites
represent the majority culture (although there are many ethnic minorities
who have fallen into the very trap that you are struggling with, and believe
otherwise). The trap is the easy way out.
	For yourself, I think it would be a good idea to realize that the
demographics related to the crimes you speak of have less to do with race,
and much to do with socioeconomic status and disenfranchisement. You're
going to find higher crime within *any* community comprised of *any* ethnic
group or subgroup that has become dysfunctional, whatever the factors
leading to that dysfunction. With ethnic minorities it is more usually than
not, as I said, socioeconomic disenfranchisement.
	If, for example, you lived in an area where there were very few
Blacks, but quite a few poor-for-generations Whites, you'd see the crime
statistics reflecting the dysfunction of those White people. Would you then
worry about whther your children would begin to see Whites as undesireable
or whatever? The trap springs into action when our innate compunction to
define "us" and "other" raises its little voice. The trap becomes dangerous
when we stop to listen to that little voice and stop thinking like rational
humans.
	It's interesting that Blacks are traditionally seen as *the* or the
*most* criminal element in many of our urban areas. I don't know the racial
makeup of Phoenix, so I can't speak to your situation. However, I live in
San Francisco, a city that loves to tout its "ethnic diversity". Here, we
have Black gangs, Hispanic gangs, Asian (yes, the "model minority") gangs,
and even a few White gangs. The Asian gangs have become a particularly
troublesome element for law enforcement here, mainly due (I think) to their
propensity for engaging in organized criminal activities. But ask people on
the street and they'll, 8-out-of-10 times, tell you that Black gangs and
crime are what they most fear. During the "disturbance" in Los Angeles last
year many of the rioters and looters were not Black. Some were even White! I
remember being amazed at  television news scenes that showed looting mobs
where there were maybe one or two Blacks at most! My perceptions, gleaned
from TV news, were further corroborated by numerous friends and relatives
that live in Los Angeles. This may have been the country's first truly
multi-ethnic riot. Yet I know from face-to-face and online discussion that
in the minds of America the popular perception is that it was a *Black*
riot!
	In closing, I'd like to say that you raise some interesting points
that really need discussion. Our country has spent too long ignoring the
racism (and its attendant ills) that is very much a part of our culture. As
a people, we are afraid to face up to some hurtful truths, and the problem
becomes compounded *daily*. We cannot afford to do it much longer. I truly
believe that the  well-being of ALL OF US depends on changing our current
course of denial and repression.
	I wish you and your children, and all other people, of *all* colors,
luck in avoiding the "trap". 
	Peace, my brother.

It is true that Mormons believe that all spirits (including Jesus,
Lucifer, Robert Weiss) are in the same family.  It does not mean
that Jesus was created, but rather that Lucifer and Robert Weiss
were not.  I agree that this is a "heresy".  So what?  
The sweating of blood in Gethsemene is
not a basic Mormon doctrine.  Jesus did not perform the atonement
in Getheseme alone, as some anti-Mormons are trying to teach.  
As far as the "unpardonable sin" whatever that is, it is Biblical,
and not specifically Mormon.  It is also called the sin against
the Holy Ghost.  Most Bible scholars (other than conservative
ones) do not believe Jehovah and Elohim were always the same.
I'm sure you've heard of the J and the E texts?  I don't
know what you mean by "That He needed to be saved".  Jesus?
Jehovah?  Elohim?  In Mormon doctrine, Jesus was sinless,
and thus did not "need to be saved".

I was curious to check out how many San Jose Mercury News mentioned
Tyre (1990-92). Here's the outcome from the research (condenced versions,
copyright San Jose Mercury news):

---
  Bombings in the two largest cities in southern Lebanon killed 11 people
and 
wounded 80 others. A car bomb blew up in Tyre, killing 10 people and
wounding 
75. A man was killed and five others seriously wounded in an explosion in 
Nabatiye.
---
  An Israeli navy patrol boat attacked and sank a rubber guerrilla boat off

southern Lebanon early today, killing the two men aboard, the army command 
said.
  
     It said in a communique that a Dvora patrol boat opened fire on the 
motorized rubber dinghy north of Tyre after identifying it as hostile. The
army 
said no one on the Israeli boat was injured. The affiliation of the slain 
guerrillas was not immediately known.
---
  Rival factions of the guerrilla group led by terrorist mastermind Abu
Nidal 
battled Sunday in Tyre, Lebanon, with machine guns and rocket-propelled 
grenades, killing at least four people and wounding 15, police said.
---
 Lebanon's mainstream Shiite Muslim militia said Thursday that it had 
uncovered a network of tunnels in a southern Lebanese village where it said
pro-
Iranian kidnappers had held Western hostages.
  
     Officials of the militia, Amal, led local journalists through the
catacomb-
like alleys and showed them two cells with iron doors at the village, 
Kawthariyet al Siyad, near Tyre, the ancient port city, about 40 miles
south of 
Beirut.
  
     The officials said they were certain that U.S. Marine Lt. Col. William
R. 
Higgins was detained there shortly after he was seized by gunmen on a road 
outside Tyre in February 1988.
--------------
...anyway, I counted 20 articles during these 3 years of reporting. I also
found out the possible reason why the numbers for the inhabitants of the
city is defined between 14000 and 24000. It seems that Tyre is one of the
places
where people from Libanon flee to during more extensive bombings, so
there's
a constant flow of refugees entering and leaving Tyre (articles mentioned
thousands of people entering and leaving this place).

I counted 0 articles for my home town, Kristinestad, so from now I will
consider this place to be a fishing village :-).

Cheers,
Kent

The cads! The fact that this is precisely what the US was up to of
course is not mentioned. It is a fact that Regan and Bush sold arms
to Iran, it is also a fact that they supported and armed Iraq.

Still this is state dept propaganda so none too surprizing.

In the case of Lybia there is the problem that the US only decided
that Gadffii ordered the bombing after it needed to make peace with
damascus during the gulf war. One day the US is certain that its Syria,
the next Lybia. For a strange reason the US will not provide evidence to
Lybian courts for extradition proceedings. Faced with similar demands the
USA would reject them as would any other country.

The word is "terrorism".


The problem is that after the behaviour of George Bush the USA has an
image abroad as doing precisely what it likes and is in its own interests
then comming out with a Dysney scripted sugary justification repeating a
fitting combination of the words "freedom" "dignity" "democaracy" or
of "terrorism" "dictatorship" etc as appropriate.

The USA could go quite far to mend the bridges with  Iran. The people there are
rather pissed off because the USA first supported the Shah who they
loathed and then supported Saddam when he mounted an unprovoked attack. 
Hardly surprizing after the embassy hostage crisis but Iran is meant to be
the country run by unreasonable bigots not the USA so if there is to be
movement it would be easier for the USA to move.

First off they could recognise Iraqu's responsibility in initiating the
Iran/Iraq war. Providing technical assistance to Iran to get it's oil
production back up to capacity would also be a smart move, at the moment 
Iran is above it's OPEC ceiling. If they had extra capacity they would
use it and bring down the oild price further which is in our interests.

The Iranian clerics would have an interest in seeking a raprochment 
simply because a permanent war footing is debilitating. They also need
western technology.

FYI:  The actual horizontal dot placement resoution of an HP
deskjet is 1/600th inch.  The electronics and dynamics of the ink
cartridge, however, limit you to generating dots at 300 per inch.
On almost any paper, the ink wicks more than 1/300th inch anyway.

The method of depositing and fusing toner of a laster printer
results in much less spread than ink drop technology.

It doesn't take much investigation to see that the mechanical and
electronic complement of a laser printer is more complex than
inexpensive ink jet printers.  Recall also that laser printers
offer a much higher throughput:  10 ppm for a laser versus about 1
ppm for an ink jet printer.

Something else to think about is the cost of consumables over the
life of the printer.  A 3000 page yield toner cartridge is about
$US 75-80 at discount while HP high capacity (~500-1000 page yield)
cartridges are about $US 22 at discount.  It could be that over the
life cycle of the printer that consumables for laser printers are
less than ink jet printers.  It is getting progressively closer
between the two technologies.  Laser printers are usually desinged
for higher duty cycles in pages per month and longer product
replacement cycles.

The test isn't whether GM knew--otherwise that would reward GM for its
stupidity.  The test is whether GM reasonably should have known of their
existence.  It works both ways--if GM had won the trial, and the plaintiff
turned up two witnesses who came forward after the first trial who should
have been located beforehand, too bad, so sad--no new trial.

Like Tim said, you don't get a new civil trial because you screwed up 
the first time around.  Unlike the criminal justice system, repose is
much more important in the civil justice system.

News-Software: VAX/VMS VNEWS 1.41    

I just installed a Motorola XC68882RC50 FPU in an Amiga A2630 board (25 MHz
68030 + 68882 with capability to clock the FPU separately).  Previously
a MC68882RC25 was installed and everything was working perfectly.  Now the
systems displays a yellow screen (indicating a exception) when it check for
the presence/type of FPU.  When I reinstall an MC68882RC25 the system works
fine, but with the XC68882 even at 25 MHz it does not work.  The designer
of the board mentioned that putting a pullup resistor on data_strobe (470 Ohm)
might help, but that didn't change anything.  Does anybody have some
suggestions what I could do?  Does this look like a CPU-FPU communications
problem or is the particular chip dead (it is a pull, not new)?
Moreover, the place I bought it from is sending me an XC68882RC33.  I thought
that the 68882RC33 were labeled MC not XC (for not finalized mask design). 
Are there any MC68882RC33?

Thanks

   Level 5?  Out of how many?  What are the different levels?  I've never
   heard of this rating system.  Anyone care to clue me in?

This is a rating system used by ARPA and other organisations to
measure the maturity of a `software process' i.e. the entire process
by which software gets designed, written, tested, delivered, supported
etc.

See `Managing the Software Process', by Watts S. Humphrey, Addison
Wesley 1989. An excellent software engineering text. The 5 levels of
software process maturity are:

1. Initial
2. Repeatable
3. Defined
4. Managed
5. Optimizing

The levels are approximately characterized as follows:

1. no statistically software process control. Have no statistical
   basis for estimating how large software will be, how long it will
   take to produce, how expensive it will be, or how reliable it will
   be.  Most software production is at this level.

2. stable process with statistical controls, rigorous project
   management; having done something once, can do it again. Projects
   are planned in detail, and there is software configuration
   management and quality assurance.

3. The process is defined and understood, implementation is
   consistent. This includes things like software inspection, a
   rigorous software testing framework, more configuration management,
   and typically a `software engineering process group' within the
   project.

4. Statistical information on the software is systematically gathered
   and analysed, and the process is controlled on the basis of this
   information. Software quality is measured and has goals.

5. Defects are prevented, the process is automated, software contracts
   are effective and certified.

No arguements following, just the facts.

I was able to avoid an accident by revving my engine and having my

I instinctively revved my engine before I went for my horn. Don't know
why, but I did it and it worked. Thats rather important.

I am not saying "the louder the pipes the better". My Harley is loud
and it gets me noticed on the road for that reason. I personally do
not feel it is to loud. If you do, well thats to bad; welcome to

If you really want a fine tuned machine like our federal government
to get involved and pass Db restrictions; it should be generous
enough so that a move like revving your engine will get you noticed.
Sure there are horns but my hand is already on the throttle. Should we

IMO, a Christian has no need of weapons.  I know it is very contrary to the
American NRA ethos of the right to bear arms, but Christians should rely on
the strength of God to protect them.  Note that I say *should*.  We are
inherently insecure but I feel that that is not proper justification to be
armed to the teeth.  A Christian should not have to rely on physical weapons
to defend himself.  A Christian should rely on his faith and intelligence.
For instance, I have the faith that God will protect me but God also gave
me the intelligence to know not to go walking down that dark alley at night.
To jump off a cliff and say that God will save me would be putting God to the
test.  And who are we to test God?

God be with you,

It works for me. I avoid obscenities, and try to remain calm cool and 
collected, and try something like, "You almost just killed me, and I'm not 
moving until you apologize." or something more or less benign like that. I 
haven't been shot a single time, but I don't do it in Texas, and I do only 
do it when there are plenty of witnesses around.

I have never worked with really small signals before and have a few 
questions about low level noise.  I have noticed that the waveform 
synthesizer that I am using (Analogic 2020) has some relatively large
common mode noise on it.  I am using this synthesizer to 'null' out another
transient waveform and am amplifying the difference (~200uV) several hundred 
times.  The 2020 has about 1-3 mVp-p of common mode noise and this tends to
make my measurements hard to repeat.  (The noise is not quite in sync with 
line frequency, and on a spectrum analyzer, the main component is about 64Hz).

How can I get rid of the noise?  When I look at the spectrum using an
HP 3582A (audio range analyzer), the noise goes away the minute I switch to 
'isolation' on the input.  I am guessing the anlayzer has a diff amp on the 
input since it will read accurately down to DC.

Also, if I use a differential amplifier (IA) to solve the problem, 
how important is it to use one of these 'shield drivers' (an amp connected 
to the shield in sort of a feedback loop to remove trouble caused 
by different cable capacitances)?  If anyone can suggest a good IC IA for 
use with transient signals with content from 1KHz to about 300KHz, I would
appreciate it.

Insofar as several "liberal" jurisdictions are concerned, the essential
elements of rape are gender neutral. Nonetheless, I decided to provide
a number of references to support my original argument. Black's Law
Dictionary (every law student/lawyer's friend) defines rape as: Unlawful
sexual intercourse with a female without her consent. The unlawful
knowledge of a woman by a man forcibly and against her will. The Model
Penal Code (the statute proposed by the National Conference of Commissioners
of Uniform State Laws or other organization for adoption by state legislatures)
defines rape as: A male who has sexual intercourse with a female not his wife
is guilty of rape if he (a) compels her to submit by force or by threat of
imminent death.... (MPC @213.1(1)(a))

Indeed the following jurisdictions/states have statutes similar to the MPC:

Alabama-- Code of Ala. @13A-6-61 (1992)
Arkansas--Ark.Stat.Ann. @5-14-103 (1993)
District of Columbia--D.C. Code @22-2801 (1992)
Georgia--O.F.G.A. @16-6-1 (1992)
Idaho--Idaho Code @18-6101 (1992)
Maryland--Md.Ann.Code.Art. 27 @462 (1992)
Mississippi--Miss.Code Ann. @97-3-71 (1993)
New York (check case law)--N.Y.C.L.S. Penal @130.35 (1993)
North Carolina--N.C. Gen.Stat. @14-27-2 (1992)
Puerto Rico--L.P.R.A. @4062 (1993)

Which, considering the amount Bush&congress added to it, would be a
not-inconsiderable achievement.

While we're on the subject, I also believe that the supply-side claim that
reducing taxes raised revenue is also false, because they typically factor in
SocSec taxes, which were *raised* a considerable amount, at the same time that
income taxes were cut.  If you look at income tax revenue alone, it fell after
after the cuts began, and didn't recover for several years. By then, record
deficits were well entrenched.

Yes,

Take Interstate I-70 to the route 48 exit.  Go south on 48 about
2-1/2 miles.  Trun right on Shiloh Springs Road.  The hamvention is
at the Harrah arena, which is about 1 mile west and on the north
side of the Road.  Parking at the arena is limited.  Lodging is
probably entirely booked-up within a 40 mile radius.  Good luck.

It is possible to park at the mall to the west.  There are shuttle
busses running between the arena and the mall.

If possible, get a Montgomery County, OH map from your local AAA
office.  It should be free if you are an AAA member.

If you don't already have definite plans, now is not a particularly
good time to start to think about going to the hamvention.

Yes, very serious.  I claim that I can substantiate my statement that
Rudman says he doesn't believe Perot was investigating him.  You claim
Perot was investigating him.  If you will state that you were in error
on this point, provided I produce the source, I'll go dig it up.

Sci.E(E) netters:

I am setting out to build and market a small electronic device that 
requires an LCD display.  All of the analog electronics are working 
fine, I have ordered a PIC ICE (not vice versa) since the PICs are so 
cheap and low-power, but I am having a devil of a time finding any 
LCD displays in the 6-8 digit range that are priced as low as I need.  I 
am looking for somthing in the range of $1 in quantities of about 
1000-10,000.

Mainstream distributors like Almac cannot help me without a part 
number, or when they do look around for something in their line 
they find a $15 8-digit LCD.  Even Digikey's cheapest offering is $5 in 
quantity.

I know LCD displays like this must exist because I see whole 
calculators for sale for $4.99, meaning the retailer probably buys it 
for $3.50 and the wholesaler probably gets it for $2.50 or so.  This 
$2.50 includes assembly labor, packaging, sales, transportation, 
import duties, the case and keyboard, the PC Board, the processor 
chip, the solar cell --- and the LCD.  The LCD can't cost much.

If anyone could put me in touch with some manufacturers and/or 
distributors that handle such things I would be much obliged.

P.S.  I have tried tearing apart several cheap consumer devices that 
have LCDs only to find that the LCDs are unlabelled.  Has anyone else 
had better luck with this strategy?

I don't think so at first,  but solid state offered  better reliabity,

You selfish little bastard. Afraid you might have to sacrafice somthing

I would agree entirely with these three paragraphs. But did the Hurt
study make any distinction between an *ability* to swerve and a *failure*
to swerve? In most of the accidents and near accidents that I've seen, riders
will almost always stand on the brakes as hard as they dare, simply because
the instinct to brake in the face of danger is so strong that it over-rides
everything else. Hard braking and swerving tend to be mutually exclusive
manouvres - did Hurt draw any conclusions on which one is generally preferable?




Folks,

I am assembling info for a Film Criticism class final project.

Essentially I need any/all movies that use motos in any substantial
capacity (IE; Fallen Angles, T2, H-D & the Marlboro Man,
Raising Arizona, etc).  
Any help you fellow r.m'ers could give me would be much `preciated.
(BTW, a summary of bike(s) or plot is helpful but not necessary)

Thanx

How typical.  So you think we shouldn't avoid these 'events' [ I shall

when we can.  In case you didn't realize it, the natural disasters [ oops,

ones we do.

I guess you missed the show on Ch 20 earlier this week about the disaster
[ oops there I go again... I meant to say event ] on the Exxon Valdez.
Just a natural every day occurance to spread oil on 300 Miles of beach. I
would like to know which natural event [ hey I remembered not to say disaster ]
that would be similar to this.

Hmm, I suppose you could be right.  They are as natural as a tree, or a

So look, if you want to worship a oil slick ( or toxic waste dump or live

permission to do so [ yea right like you need MY permission... ], it just
won't be in the neighborhood where I live.  But DON'T try to push your
shortsighted tunnelvision views off on the rest of us.

 The balls are used to reduce the amplitude of oscillations of the wire during
periods of high winds.  I've seen what looks like paint cans filled with
concrete used for the same purpose.

	There SHOULD be a connection of the GROUND wire to a ground
in the breaker box.  There also should be a connection of the NEUTRAL
wire to a ground in the breaker box.  There should be no other 
place in the building where such a connection occurs (i.e. not in
any of the outlet boxes).

	The NEUTRAL (white) wire is a 'grounding conductor' for
the plug, and is NOT safe to touch, while the GROUND (green)
wire is a 'protective ground' and carries no current unless
some kind of electrical fault has occurred.  It's safe
to touch the protective ground, but not to touch the 
grounding conductor (because there is current in the grounding
conductor, its outlet-box end will not be at the same ground
potential as its breaker-box end).

The difference in the litigation environment is reflected in the fees.

Lack of defensive medicine and near-absence of malpractice is really
why we spend less using the most expensive approach of pure insurance
in Canada (along with France and Germany) without HMO's --- the NYT
has admitted that malpractice insurance fees are an order of magnitude
lower in Canada but doctors take-home pay is almost equal to American
doctors; also, minimal bureaucracy 'cos the system is so-o-o simple
(early March).

Part of the deal for using the all-insurance approach like the French
and Germans do (hey, why don't they criticize France and Germany?  Is
it because too many people take French and German in college to make
the accusations stick? (-;) was to preserve the doctors independance.
Since the provincial wings of the CMA are the ones that go to bat when
the fee schedule hikes are presented, the politically-bent doctors
were just cackling when they realized the CMA would grow in strength
rather than diminish, especially when unopposed unlike in socialized
medicine approaches like Britain's National Health Service.

For non-life threatening things, market arguments adequately cover why
certain procedures are in scarcer demand.  I have MD friends who can't
make a living as specialists back in Manitoba not due to the insurance
rates but because they won't get enough customers -- the CMA medical
monopoly's grip on doctors licencing (as in the US) aside -- so they
must move to larger places.  However, this does not refute debunking
of waiting lines for urgent AND routine care, as has been done in the
U.S. by Consumers Reports, health policy studies cited by Prof. Dennis
E. Shea on USENET, CNN, NYT, etc.

Doug Fierro has posted a NYT article from 3 weeks ago about Canada's
health insurance approach, on Talk.politics.medicine.  There is one
small error in the article: not all of our hospitals are private.

>WOULDN'T NATIONAL HEALTH INSURANCE MEAN THAT AMERICANS WHO ARE NOW

>a month.  

Of course, the one thing to note is that in the Canada/France/Germany
case, private insurance *offloaded* the basic coverage to the public
sector.  They realized they were keeping low-risk/high-profit extra
insurance for things like private/semi-private rooms (vs. ward
accomodation), dental, glasses, etc. for corporate or personal
benefits, they'll have nothing to do with you if you want to be
covered for basic care.

At that point, they wouldn't even consider a "voucher" approach
to broker the universal coverage and sell policies to make up
the difference in the federal guidelines and market stuff.

It is "free" in that there are no deductibles nor copayments (two
things which I advocate to make the Canadian insurance look more like
real health insurance -- which actually it is).  I know that when
working in Alberta, Ontario and Quebec, I was aware that I was paying
for health insurance - e.g., in Toronto, OHIP fees were listed on my
pay stub; Manitoba did not collect at paycheque time, but only
annually at income tax time (built into the tax rate).  Only fiscal
naifs will proclaim that it's free, along with the Canadian Left for
that is part of their brainwashing agenda.

The French do have copayments, though.  France Magazine's Summer 
1992 edition has a fantastic presentation of their basic insurance
coverage, including a sample chart of copayment percentages.  For 
1-30 days, you're covered for 80% of the public hospital rate, 100%
afterward.  With extra private insurance, you can get into a private
hospital and be covered for any differences beyond the public hospital
rate.  The public insurance covers 100% beyond 30 days, or the same
cash amount for a private hospital and the difference is paid
out-of-pocket or according to your supplementary private insurance.
Over 2/3rds of French have some form of extra private insurance.  So,
the other 30% of health costs in Europe are out of private funds, not
gleaned from other taxes.  The GDP figures are combined public and
private expenditures for total outlay using the same methods that
yield the 13-14% figure for the U.S.

Health insurance does exist in Canada and in Western Europe, its
just that it doesn't cover basic care.  You can opt out in Canada
and Germany, but you'll have to go uninsured as a result because
there are too few other people that do so --- i.e., no market.

When private insurance realized how much money they'd make without the
risks involved in basic insurance (e.g., neurosurgery) versus deluxe
amenities (e.g., having to call Granada TV to replace a rental set on
the fritz in someone's private hospital room), they started to pat
themselves on the back for their social responsibility.  In Quebec
last spring, a consortium of private insurers publicly warned against
any thoughts of privatizing routine, low cost parts of that province's
public health insurance plan.

ARIANESPACE FLIGHT 56

(Flight V.56 was originally intended to carry the Hughes HS-601 series 
Galaxy IV satellite, but the payload was withdrawn just prior to flight.)

The 56th Ariane launch is now scheduled to place the ASTRA 1C and ARSENE 
satellites into an improved geostationary transfer orbit (GTO), with 
inclination reduced to 5 degrees and apogee altitude increased by 150 km.
This will be the 28th launch of an Ariane 4 and the first in the 42L 
configuration, with 2 liquid strap-on boosters (PAL).  It will be launched
from the newly refurbished Ariane launch complex ELA 2, in Kourou - French 
Guiana.

The launch vehicle performance requirement for this mission is 3,147 kg
of which 2,944 kg represents the satellite mass.  The total vehicle mass
at liftoff is 361,778 kg.


Required Orbit Characteristics:
  Perigee Altitude ..... 200 km
  Apogee Altitude ...... 36,160 km at injection 
  Inclination ..........   5 degrees


The Ariane 42L lift-off for Flight 56 is scheduled on Thursday,
April 29, 1993, as soon as possible within the following launch 
window:

     Kourou Time        GMT (04/30/93)      Washington, DC
     21:52 - 22:50      00:52 - 01:50       20:52 - 21:50


LAUNCH VEHICLE:

Ariane 42L.  This is a three-stage liquid fueled launcher with two liquid 
fueled strap-on boosters.  The first stage (L220) is built by Aerospatiale,
and is powered by 4 liquid fueled Viking V engines.  The second stage (L33)
is built by MBB Erno and is powered by a single Viking IV engine.  Both the
Viking IV and V engines are manufactured by SEP.  The first and second stages
use a biliquid UH25/N2O4 fuel. The third stage (H10) is built by Aerospatiale,
and is powered by a cryogenic H2/O2 fueled HM-7B engine built by SEP. The two
strap-on boosters (PAL) are each powered by a Viking VI engine, also built 
by SEP, which use the same biliquid fuel as the first and second stages.  
The fully assembled launch vehicle stands 56 meters high on the pad.  
It uses the Type 01 Ariane Short payload fairing.


Flight Profile:

 +02:21  Liquid strap-on booster jettison
 +03:11  First stage separation
 +03:18  Second stage ignition
 +04:10  Fairing jettison

LAUNCH COVERAGE:

All Ariane missions are broadcast live via satellite from Kourou. 
Coverage begins at 30 minutes before launch and continues until 
all payloads have been deployed.  This mission will likely be carried
in the US on Galaxy 6, however it could be Galaxy 7 or another satellite.
(What is the European satellite normally used for Ariane coverage?)

Michael Adams, nsmca@acad3.alaska.edu -- I'm not high, just jacked

Alive in Nome, Alaska (once called Russian America).



Replying to A.J. Teel:

	Well, the two nifty letters giving concrete proof that the
	Income Tax is voluntary and giving specific procedures for
	stopping withholding, et cetera have been out there for a
	while now.

Humbug.  Those letters don't provide "concrete proof" of anything at all
in the absence of any case law that demonstrates the method will actu-
ally work for ordinary people in everyday situations.

Specifically, show us some case law in which the courts have ruled that
income tax is illegal and/or that ordinary working types do not have to
pay income tax (and that they can legally avoid paying income tax with-
out declaring themselves to be churches or some such silliness).  This
issue is sufficiently important that I think we have a right to expect
something squarely on point from the US Supreme Court (in the case of
federal tax) or a state's supreme court (for a state's income tax).

Unless you can do that, I for one am unwilling to call your material
"concrete proof".

	There has been no refutation to date.  Have the nay-sayers
	finally given up as defeated?  Sure would like to hear their
	reasons for disbelief at this point.

Refutation??  Refutation of what?  You haven't made a case yet.  You've
posted plenty of claims, but you haven't given us any valid reason to
believe that any court in the US will agree with you.  Your claims seem
on the surface to deviate so radically from the legal mainstream that I
feel the burden of proof is still on =you= to show that your arguments
have any merit whatsoever.  And the cases you've cited involve such
strange situations that I see no reason to assume that the rulings are
applicable to anyone else, or that they will ultimately stand on appeal
to the Supreme Court.

Why can't you just cite us a case in which Joe Schmoe, a regular
employee earning regular wages from a regular company, refuses to pay
his income tax, gets hauled into court, is convicted of wilful tax eva-
sion, and then has his conviction overturned by the US Supreme Court
with a landmark 7-2 majority ruling that income tax is indeed totally
voluntary?  What, you say?  No such case exists?  Hmmm, I wonder why
not; why haven't you?

	Shall I conclude that the point has been received and the
	opposition has forfeited the field?

With all due respect, you can conclude anything you want.  I just hope,
for your own sake, that you don't conclude that anyone in a position of
authority in the United States or any legitimate or illegitimate polit-
ical subdivision thereof is going to agree with your conclusions.

For that matter, I confess I'm thoroughly confused as to =why= you would
be looking for court rulings in your favor anyway -- since I thought you
told us earlier that every court in the US has been in cahoots with big
banking interests since the 1938 "admiralty jurisdiction" coverup thing.
Do you honestly expect us to believe that they'd go to all the trouble
to subvert the system, and yet would still promptly slink back into
their burrows in the face of anyone who knew enough to invoke the right
combination of magic spells and mystic mumbo-jumbo?

Not only that, but why do you even =care= what the US courts say anyway?
Didn't you tell us a while back that you've disavowed all attempts by US
officials to classify you as a "14th Amendment federal citizen"?  When
the FBI comes to haul you away for tax evasion, why don't you just tell
them they're out of their jurisdiction and should go back to Washington,
D.C., where they belong?

Or maybe we should all just go back to mediaeval common law, which you
suggested would be better than all these statutes, codes, and the like.
If you want to renounce society's legal framework, fine; we can just
declare you an outlaw, OK?, and anyone who sees you driving on the roads
with no license plate on your car and no driver's license in your wallet
can just take you like a game animal and stew you for their supper (with
plenty of veggies and a pinch of salt, but WITHOUT PREJUDICE UCC 1-207).

Sorry, everyone, it's getting late, and I'm sick and tired of all this
garbage.  If I know what's good for me, I'll just clam up and stop try-
ing to refute this nonsense, and if anyone falls for it and winds up in
jail for tax evasion or what-not, it'll be on their own head.

Needless to say, none of the above represents the opinions of my current
employer -- who, in any case, is a Canadian and doesn't really need to
care too much about US tax law.  I, on the other hand, am a "14th Amend-
ment federal citizen", with a US passport to prove it, and plan to keep
on filing Form 1040's for the foreseeable future (though I will probably
not owe any US income tax due to the foreign earned income exclusion
and/or the foreign tax credit).

Only if you have a weeny insurance company. Unless it's
some stupid PA law.  I know that if some jerk hits me while 
I'm in a parking lot, if my insruance company doesn't sue
his (or his doesn't immediately say, 'Yes, it's his fault')
I'll sure him myself and tell my insurance company to go to
hell if they raise my rates.

This is really the only thing we disagree on. Maybe we should agree to

to the right is unnecessarily confusing, when they'll do it anyway if they
just get on the bike and ride the damn thing.

Jeez, Ed, when you started talking about traction management policies I
thought you were making some weird reference to looking after railway
locomotives...

The official line here (though I do have my doubts about it) is that the
front brake is applied first, followed by the rear brake, the idea being
that you avoid locking up the rear after weight transfer takes place. In
practice I suspect most people do what you describe.

If you don't slide the tyre, you have no way of knowing whether you've
achieved maximum braking or not. I'm not suggesting that you should always
aim to brake as hard as you possibly can - but if you want to find the
limits of the machine, you have to go beyond them. 

In any case, for maximum braking, if (as I suggested) you aim to keep
both wheels just on the point of sliding, then you'll be doing
exactly as *you* suggest!!

First off, let me congratulate you for not posting a flame about "You sick
perverts, you are immoral, you are all going to hell.", which seems to be the
usual "religious" post found on the alt.sex.* hierarchy.  Hopefully, you won't
get flamed, either.

You will, however, be argued with.  I personally think that your project is
built on unsteady ground.

First, I do not believe that there is any way to find an "objective morality". 
Morality and value are inherently subjective - they represent the beliefs of a
person or a group of people.  They can be widely held, perhaps even
overwhelmingly held, but they are never and _can_ never be objective.

Second, I do not accept the assumptions that you make here.  If, as you say,
you are trying to be objective, then why accept a morality to begin with by
using the Christian Bible?  You're defeating your own purpose by doing so.

Third, call me a pessimist, but you won't stop the flamage.  There will always
be people who pop upin alt.sex.* to tell us how sick and twisted and evil we
all are.  Just out of curiosity, do alt.sex readers show up unprovoked in the
religion groups to tell you all that you are narrow-minded, censoring,
overbearing totalitarianists?

Hm.  Let me provide an example.  Four people get together over dinner, to
discuss morality: you, me, a rather conservative Moslem, and a sociopath.  I
start off by saying that I think it's immoral to force people to have sex with
you.  You agree, but also say that it is immoral to have sex with someone of
your own gender.  (Just a note: I really don't know your views on
homosexuality, I am just using this as a common view of morality for the
purposes of this example.)  The Moslem says that it is immoral for women to
have their faces uncovered.

The sociopath, who has become bored, kills all three of us and eats us, but
feels no guilt because he has done nothing wrong morally in his own mind.

I'm not going to accept your evidence for this.  You ask us to accept "The Word
of God" that everything good comes from God.  This is only a valid argument for
a person who shares your beliefs.

Still, I must say that cataloging the major themes and motifs in erotica could
be interesting for other reasons than yours, so good luck with this next part.

One could construe this to mean that beautiful people are better, or "more
good" than non-beautiful people.  I would hope that people relize that this is
not necessarily true.

Yes, and this theme is usually what the better stories are about.  However,
they are not always selfish - I could point to examples in the work of Elf
Sternberg, for example.

It serves the same purpose as it does in pornographic movies: it affirms the
virility of the male involved, as well as assuring the reader that he (the
character) has orgasmed.

Your Whole Picture [TM] unfortunately only applies to people who accept your
church.
         
In addition, if sex is for procreation, then

1)	Why did God make it pleasurable, so that people would want to do it,
rather than building it in as instinct?
2)	Why did God make it fallible?  Not every sexual encounter results in
pregnancy, even among Catholics.  Does this mean that they have sinned?

Pornography would not tend in those directions if there were not a demand for
it.  Many people have violent fantasies that they would never act out in real
life, but will think about and read about and mull over.

1.  The Magellan mission at Venus continues normally, gathering gravity
data which provides measurement of density variations in the upper
mantle which can be correlated to surface topography.  Spacecraft
performance is nominal.

2.  Magellan has completed 7225 orbits of Venus and is now 39 days from
the end of Cycle-4 and the start of the Transition Experiment.

3.  No significant activities are expected next week, as preparations
for aerobraking continue on schedule.

4.  On Monday morning, April 19, the moon will occult Venus and
interrupt the tracking of Magellan for about 68 minutes.

Summary: GM's quest for justice

	A judge denied GM's new trial motion, even though GM says it has two
new witnesses that said the occupant of the truck was dead from the impact, not
from the fire.

	Thoughts?

	It's kind of scary when you realize that judges are going to start
denying new trials even when new evidence that contradicts the facts that led
to the previous ruling appear.

	Or has the judge decided that the new witnesses are not to be believed? 
Shouldn't that be up to a jury?

	And what about members of the previous jury parading through the talk
shows proclaiming their obvious bias against GM?  Shouldn't that be enough for
a judge to through out the old verdict and call for a new trial?

	Whatever happened to jurors having to be objective?

I don't think that this is accurate. I believe, and could be wrong, that
there IS a specific right allegedly to have been violated, like the

Double jeopardy does not apply, but not for the reasons you quote. Double
jeopardy states that a person may not be tried twice on the same charge.
However, the police are not on trial for the crime of excessive force
or assault. They are NOW on trial for the DIFFERENT crime of violating
Mr. King's civil rights. 

AS for the city and county or state trying you more than once, 
it most likely will not happen. This is because cities and states
have separate laws governing behaviour. For example, in some states,
it is an offence to carry marijuana, but not a city offence. Also,
I think murder is against federal, but not some state laws.

I'll second that!! I saw a list somewhere of all the stuff that it was

Seriously though, why take the risk? You are extremely unlikely to get

To maintain my senses at their sharpest, I never eat a full meal
within 24 hrs of a ride.   I've tried Slim Fast Lite before a 
ride but found that my lap times around the Parliament Buildings suffered 
0.1 secs.   The resultant 70 pound weight loss over the summer
just sharpens my bike's handling and I can always look
forward to a winter of carbo-loading.

Excellently put!

Even as a libertarian, I have to admit government does do some things I
like.  There is a beautiful performing arts complex in Ft.  Lauderdale
that was partially built with tax dollars (I don't know how much was
private and how much was stolen, I mean public) but it is beautiful and
I enjoy it.  (Keep in mind, though, most of the people in the city will
never attend a single performance there, so they might feel differently
about having to help pay for it.)

However, I have to disagree about it being desireable or efficient to
give government intervention-power on a case-by-case basis.  In fact,
we have a lot better luck maintaining our freedom of speech precisely
because it is not decided on a case-by-case basis as much as other
issues.  Judges decide whether political speech is allowed on the
sidewalk in front of the post office.  They do not try to decide just
whether pro-nazi, pro-choice, pro-life, or pro-tax political speech
should be allowed on the sidewalk in front of the post office.  You can
imagine the result if right to free speech was decided by the majority
on a case-by-case basis.

Not so with economic issues.  Government does tell taxi-drivers exactly
what they can charge, but not the bus lines or the lawyers.

Just as it is not desireable to decide rights of free speech on a
case-by-case basis, we should not decide rights to free enterprise on a
case-by-case basis.

There is hope that a government can be restricted from interferring with
free enterprise.  But there is no hope, in my opinion, of having a
government that interferes with free enterprise in an "efficient"
manner; I call it political market failure.

Thus, if you value freedom and the abundance it produces, you have to
swallow the "whole libertarian agenda."

The father of a friend of mine is a police officer in West Virginia.  Not  
only is his word as a skilled observer good in court, but his skill as an  
observer has been tested to be more accurate than the radar gun in some  
cases . . ..  No foolin!  He can guess a car's speed to within 2-3mph just  
by watching it blow by - whether he's standing still or moving too!  (Yes,  
I realize that calibrated guns are more accurate than this, but . . .).   
His ability is not that uncommon among people who watch moving things for a  
living, I have heard . . ..

So what good is a radar detector except to give you a split second warning  
that the guy who just cut you off to pass the guy ahead and to your left  
is about to panic stop from 85 on a crowded freeway???

So, is this a real story or a work of fiction?  How about some

The simplest one is easy.  Take a lemon or other citrus type fruit, and
stick a pair of metal strips into it for the contacts.  The two strips must
be of disimelar metals like copper and zinc.  Then connect a voltmeter to
the contacts and read the voltage.

OK, as one last attempt, I'll take a different tack.

We all seem to be in agreement that there are two explanations for why
one can use the handlebars to lean a moving motorcycle. The question is,
is one of the effect dominant, and which one is it? The idea would be to
design an experiment which would seaprate the two characteristics, and
see which effect produces a similar result to the one with which those of
us who have bikes are familiar.

Let's look at the one that, so far, has sparked no controversy on its
own, gyroscopic precession. To examine this alone, we would have to
get rid of the contact patch effect, by not allowing the contact patches
to transmit any force. The wheels and steering mechanism would have to
remain, and be attached to a vehicle with about the same weight as a bike,
through suspension (so that the wheels transmit forces to the bike the
same way) similar to a bikes. An experiment would be to ride a bike along 
a dry road to get moving and to get the wheels spinning, then change 
surfaces to something that won't transmit forces through the contact 
patches, and try a steering manoeuvre to see if the bike leans. It 
probably would, since some of us know how easy it is to fall down on ice, 
but we wouldn't get a good idea of how well or what it feels like 
because, without the contact patches, we can't turn.  Maybe there's a 
better way. Besides, even ice doesn't get rid of the contact patch
forces altogether, so we'd have to find a really frictionless surface.
You'd have to try it again with the wheels locked to really know if it
was the rotation that did it.

Looking at the contact-patch effect only, however, is fairly simple.
Now we have to find a vehicle that gets the about the same magnitude and
direction of cantact patch forces as a motorcycle, and transmits them
about the same way to the vehicle, but without rotating wheels.
How it gets the contact patch forces is irrelevant, we're just looking
for something that has contact patches that can go straight and not
sideways, and skis or skates would do fine. I don't know of any snow-ski
or skate bikes, but up here we have the Suzuki Wetbike that is arranged
like a motorcycle but has fat water skis where there should be wheels.
I think the propellor is in front of the rear ski, or something like
that, but we could try it at a coast to get rid of most of its effect.
Now I admit that this is second hand info (although I'd love to try
one of these), but the review in the local cycle rag and a guy in
a bike shop that sells them both say that this machine handles very
much like a motorcycle, in that you countersteer it to turn.
So we have contact patches that transmit similar forces to a bike's,
a similar suspension arrangement, and no gyroscopes, but we do have
countersteering.

Conclusion: you don't need gyroscopes to countersteer vehicles that have
motorcycle-like contact patch arrangements. We still don't know what
real effect the gyroscopes have when they're there, but from my observations
of how handlebar angle, force, etc. relate to steering in general, I'm 
willing to bet that they're not the dominant factor in countersteering. 

If you don't like this conclusion, then don't accept it, but my motorcycle's
behaviour is consistent with it. If someone can prove otherwise, go ahead.

       One of the advantages and draw-backs of requiring proof
on the part of the government before they may take action against
citizens.  (and part of the reason some of us believe weapons should
be available.)

       We are not arguing the absolute sanctity of the U.S.
Constitution.  In fact, the fillibuster we're talking about isn't
*in* the Constitution.  I objected to your suggestion that the Senate
wasn't intended to exercise the power it was clearly given.

       I'll point out again that Reagan only had a Republican Majority
in the Senate during his first term, and his coalition in the House
came apart at about the same time.  Bush never had any real support in
Congress.

       The real point is that everybody, *everywhere* got their pork,
from the big corporations to the guy I saw last night leaving a
convenience store with an armful of junk-food he'd bought with
food stamps.  (He spent more in food stamps on junk than I *make* in a week
and I'm not on government assitance.)

>Money was diverted from programs addressing
>social needs and poured into the weapons industry in the form of cost
>plus profits contracts. 

       Lessee, let's pull out the old Almanac.

       In 1980, total U.S. government budget outlays were 590.9 billion
dollars.  In 1992 (est) they were 1.4754 trillion dollars, an increase of
approx. 884 billion dollars.

       In 1980, National Defense cost 133.9 billion dollars.  In
192 it was 307 billion dollars, and increase of 174 billion dollars.
That leaves an increase of 710 billion dollars unaccounted
for.  (This represented an increase of 230%)

       In 1980, Income Security (which includes retirement programs,
Housing Assitance, and unemployment benefits, and I believe welfare)
cost 86.5 billion dollars.  In 1992 it was 198 billion dollars, or
more than national defense started.  (This represented an increase
of 230%)

       In 1980, the Federal Government spent 32 billion dollars on
Medicare.  In 1992 they spent 118 billion dollars.  (an increase of
368%)

       In 1980, the Feds spent 9 billion dollars on housing
credits and subsidies of that like.  In 1992 it was 87 billion.

       In 1980, Health care services and research was 23 billion
dollars.  In 1992, it was 94 billion dollars.

       Agriculture, up 9 billion to 17 billion.

       Science, up 11 billion to 16 billion.

       Resource conservation up 7 billion to 20 billion.

       Education up 14 billion to 45 billion.

       Veteran benefits up 12 billion to 33 billion.

       Trasnportation up 13 billion to 34 billion.
     
       About the only things I see which was seriously decreased was under 
the Energy category, primarily under "Supply," and "Community Development,"
in the area of "disaster relief," and between the two of them
represent a loss of less than 11 billion dollars.

       Where *was* this huge diversion?

>In order to rectify this situation there must
>be constitutional revision.

       Not that's a stretch.  If the current government was pushed by
the President to create this mess, wouldn't one expect it to begin to
equalize once the pressure is gone?

>Secondly the form of this revision must take account of the changed 
>circumsatnces of the role of the Federal government. 

       Only assuming that the new role is a positive role we want
to continue. I see very little positive about it.

>The constitution
>cannot be used to frustrate the democratic process. 

       The Constitution was *designed* to frustrate the democratic
process, so that the voters could be absolutely sure they were getting
what they wanted by the time it happened.  Nor do I see putting the
brakes on the "democratic process" an inherently bad thing.  Califronia's
riding the edge and every time they pull their ballot initiative nonsense
it gets worse.

>If the peoplr want
>to have welfare spending by the federal government they will have
>it.

       Sometimes, or perhaps most of the time, the people should be
told, "no," and pointed to their local government.       

>Attempting to prevent this through constitutional trickery only
>leads to the constitution being brought into disrepute. 

       Phill, would you do me the very great favor of repeating that
in talk.politics.guns?

>Methods will

       Cute.  We can eliminate violations of the law by eliminating
the law.

>This is a major reason why the right to own 
>guns should be excluded, the implication that this right is equal to
>the right to free speech is dangerous. 

       Free speech alone is dangerous, Phill.

>People know that mass ownership

>the same dangerous mistake. 

       OK, Phill.  All you gotta show me is a clear pattern of
*reduction* in homicide rates across several countries and that'll
be it.  (Not current, mind, you, reduction.)

        Who's chaining anything to freedom of speech?  By *calling*

       Phill, you're a master of subtly changing the subject.  I haven't
*based* my argument against raw democracy on the Constitution.  I've
tried to explain why it isn't a good idea.  The only time I've referred
to the Constitution is to point out it doesn't contain the restrictions
on the veto and the Senate you appear to believe were "meant," but
just didn't make it in there.
     
       The Constitution doesn't *contain* the 41% fillibuster rule.
I only believe that the rule is a good idea.  You cn't dismiss that
as venerating the Constitution because it isn't *in* the Constitution.

It appears as if the problem is related to the 68882/50's need for very fast
(and clean) signal transitions.  I got some email (Vielen Dank, Thomas) stating
that Motorola provides a solution for this problem in their 68030 manual.  
Since my manual (1989) predates the 50 MHz 68030/68882s I couldn't find it.
Could someone please email me the specifics?

Interesting discussion.

I limit myself to *one* 'standard serving' of alcohol if I'm
going to ride. And mostly, unless the alcohol is something
special (fine ale, good wine, or someone else's vsop), I usually
just don't drink *any*.

But then alcohol just isn't really important to me, mainly
for financial reasons...

At least one of the magazines claims to follow the
aviation guideline of "no alcohol whatsoever" within
24hrs of riding a 'company' bike.

Don't remember which mag though, it was a few years ago.

You can learn how to build a deyhdrator very easily from the book, "The
Hungry Hiker's Guide to Good Food," by Gretchen McHugh.  The heat source
is a 100 watt light bulb.  Basically, it's a vertical wooden box with
ventilation holes in the top and bottom (lots of them, you want the air
to flow).  The light bulb goes in the bottom, and wire cake racks are
spaced every 6" starting about 10" above the bulb.

Or, at a slightly higher cost in electricity, you can do what I do:  Use
your oven.  (NOTE - I do this in an electric oven; some gas ovens may
not have a low enough setting).  Put food to be dried on cookie tins or
racks in the oven.  Set oven to 140 degrees (the lowest setting on my
oven - if yours goes down to 120 that's probably even better.)  Stick a
wooden spoon or something across the front corner of the oven and close
the door on the spoon so that it stays open about an inch - this allows
for airflow.  Leave the stuff in the oven for 6 to 8 hours; check it
often, since this dries it much faster than the dehydrator.  If you are
using cookie sheets instead of racks, turn the stuff over halfway
through.

If you want more info, e-mail me since this isn't really the right sub
for this stuff.

In responding to the post below I have considered issues far outside the
scope of revisionism and principally have considered the political
implications of a racist ideology and its inevitable outcome. Thus it
is tangentially relevant to soc.history and alt.revisionism but I have directed
followups to t.p.m since it is principally consideration of the political
lessons to be drawn from the history of the NAZI party that I deal with.

Let us assume for the sake of argument that this was indeed the case? Does
this mean that Hilter would have been in any way less guilty of mass murder
because he aquiesced rather than participated as an active and ardent
supporter?

One of the important things to realise about the NAZIs is that the system
was far more evil than any single member. Once created the NAZI party
itself was a murder machine that would inevitably commit genocide, there was
noone within it strong enough to prevent it. Remember that Hitler did not
originaly lead the NAZI party nor was he particularly powerful within it
until his oratory allowed the party to come to power. Had Hitler reneged
upon the emotiaonal expectations which he had created within the ranks of 
his supporters he would have been replaced as he had himself replaced the
old guard who he beleived were unable to grasp the intellectual implications
of their rhetoric. 

This is why all parties that espouse NAZI style race supremacy ideologies must
be considered as dangerous and as evil as the NAZIs. The idea that one "race"
of people is inherently superior to another and that the greatest goal of
humanity is to achieve racial perfection has only one logical outcome,
the gas chambers of Auschwitz.

The NAZI party is not simply the tale of a supremely evil single man who
lead an entire country astray, beyond the evil of individuals there was the
evil of the system itself which was self generating and self perpetuating.
Hitler was an extreemly evil person who built his party arround an ego
cult centered on the demonstration of his own power, this does not however
mean that he was as entirely free from political constraints as he and
his propagandists worked so hard to assert. The myth that racism can
produce a strong government that can cure a nations ills must be 
emphatically rejected. In the same way we must accept a distinction between
a govenrment that demonstrates its strength and one that is able to 
govern decisively in the manner it beleives is best. I would accept only the
latter as a "strong" government since most displays of strength are made
necessary by an essential weakness.

It is important to understand that the NAZIs were not stupid nor were they
amoral in the sense that they lacked moral scruples. They acted in the
same manner as the Spanish Inquisition - murder and torture in the cause
of morality. The fault of the NAZIs lies in their axioms, not in their
logic nor in their implementation of those axioms. Thus all such parties
such as the National Front or David Dukes Klu Klux Klan front who assert
the truth of those axioms must be considered for what they are, advocates
of a system that would commit genocide. 

The conclusion that Hitler was not only responsible but imensely evil is
inescapable from the historical record. It is important though to not let
the conclusion be reached that the NAZIs espoused a set of ideas that
were basically correct but had an unfortunate proponent. The evils of
the concept of race supremacy are primary. Although this most emphaticaly
does not excuse individual culpability this is nevertheless secondary.

No matter what the promises made by a racist, supremacist party upon 
election those promises will be broken as soon as circumstances permit.
If this requires the replacement of the leaders that originally made
the pledges, that will occur. Hatred is a supreme justifier. It also creates
a dynamic of its own when those in government allow it reign. For many
in government politics is a method of providing a justification for
their own existence through a demonstration of their importance. A 
rhetoric of hatred inevitably develops the question of action since the
continued existence of an object of hatred is inevitably a reminder of the
essential impotence of the politician. Thus we have the US raid on Tripoli
which has little purpose beyond a demonstration of power. It is important
to realise that there is no quantum jump between the politics of the right
and those of the extreeme right but a progression from the reinforcement
of popular predjudice to action being taken on the basis of that predjudice.
In the same way the extreeme left trace their route to despotism through
their assertion of the subjugation of the individual to ideology.

It is important though that in attempting to understand the dynamics
of political systems that this is not used to excuse the participants. The
leaders of a nation take on a supreme moral burden but not only do
so voluntarily are required to stive to do so. Thus to take on such a 
task without a fundamental examination of the logical progression of
ones set of axioms to its conclusion in itself is a moral crime. Furthermore
in taking on such a duty one is obliged to put the interest of the whole
before personal concerns, even of personal security.

Although it was inevitable that a party such as the NAZIs, based upon hatred
and an idolisation of the symbols of power should have saught to commit
genocide it was not inevitable that they should succeeded. Each member of
the system had an ability to create a change within it that had a possibility
of changing the dynamic. Realising that the individual cannot hope to 
control a system does not mean accepting that the individual cannot 
affect the system.

You keep saying that. I do not think it means what you think it
means.
Perhaps you should explain what you think "science has it's basis
in values" means. The reason why people DO science is that
they value it's results. That does not mean that science has
it's basis in values. Any more than DES stops working if I stop

SSF is up for redesign again.  Let's do it right this
time!  Let's step back and consider the functionality we want:

[1] microgravity/vacuum process research
[2] life sciences research (adaptation to space)
[3] spacecraft maintenence 

The old NASA approach, explified by Shuttle and SSF so far, was to
centralize functionality.  These projects failed to meet
their targets by a wide margin: the military and commercial users 
took most of their payloads off Shuttle after wasting much effort to 
tie their payloads to it, and SSF has crumbled into disorganization
and miscommunication.  Over $50 billion has been spent on these
two projects with no reduction in launch costs and littel improvement
in commercial space industrialization.  Meanwhile, military and commercial 
users have come up with a superior strategy for space development: the 
constellation.  

Firstly, different functions are broken down into different 
constellations placed in the optimal orbit for each function:
thus we have the GPS/Navstar constellation in 12-hour orbits,
comsats in Clarke and Molniya orbits, etc.  Secondly, the task
is distributed amongst several spacecraft in a constellation,
providing for redundancy and full coverage where needed.

SSF's 3 main functions require quite different environments
and are also prime candidates for constellization.

[1] We have the makings of a microgravity constellation now:
COMET and Mir for long-duration flights, Shuttle/Spacelab for
short-duration flights.  The best strategy for this area is
inexpensive, incremental improvement: installation of U.S. facilities 
on Mir, Shuttle/Mir linkup, and transition from Shuttle/Spacelab
to a much less expensive SSTO/Spacehab/COMET or SSTO/SIF/COMET.
We might also expand the research program to take advantage of 
interesting space environments, eg the high-radiation Van Allen belt 
or gas/plasma gradients in comet tails.  The COMET system can
be much more easily retrofitted for these tasks, where a 
station is too large to affordably launch beyond LEO.

[2] We need to study life sciences not just in microgravity,
but also in lunar and Martian gravities, and in the radiation
environments of deep space instead of the protected shelter
of LEO.  This is a very long-term, low-priority project, since
astronauts will have little practical use in the space program
until costs come down orders of magnitude.  Furthermore, using
astronauts severely restricts the scope of the investigation,
and the sample size.  So I propose LabRatSat, a constellation
tether-bolo satellites that test out various levels of gravity
in super-Van-Allen-Belt orbits that are representative of the
radiation environment encountered on Earth-Moon, Earth-Mars,
Earth-asteroid, etc. trips.  The miniaturized life support
machinery might be operated real-time from earth thru a VR
interface.  AFter several orbital missions have been flown,
follow-ons can act as LDEFs on the lunar and Martian surface,
testing out the actual environment at low cost before $billions
are spent on astronauts.

[3] By far the largest market for spacecraft servicing is in 
Clarke orbit.  I propose a fleet of small teleoperated
robots and small test satellites on which ground engineers can
practice their skills.  Once in place, robots can pry stuck
solar arrays and antennas, attach solar battery power packs,
inject fuel, etc.  Once the fleet is working, it can be
spun off to commercial company(s) who can work with the comsat
companies to develop comsat replaceable module standards.

By applying the successful constellation strategy, and getting
rid of the failed centralized strategy of STS and old SSF, we
have radically improved the capability of the program while
greatly cutting its cost.  For a fraction of SSF's pricetag,
we can fix satellites where the satellites are, we can study
life's adaptation to a much large & more representative variety 
of space environments, and we can do microgravity and vacuum
research inexpensively and, if needed, in special-purpose
orbits.

N.B., we can apply the constellation strategy to space exploration
as well, greatly cutting its cost and increasing its functionality.  
Mars Network and Artemis are two good examples of this; more ambitiously 
we can set up a network of native propellant plants on Mars that can be used
to fuel planet-wide rover/ballistic hopper prospecting and
sample return.  The descendants of LabRatSat's technology can
be used as a Mars surface LDEF and to test out closed-ecology
greenhouses on Mars at low cost.

Really?  I don't get it... Genesis first says that God created the

I had a similar idea, for a fax/answering machine switch,
to put both machines on one line.  You order distinctive
ringing from your phone company.  This is $3/month here.
You get a second (unpublished) phone number.  When
someone calls this number, your phone rings with short
rings instead of long rings.

You set up your answering machine on 4 rings and your fax
on six rings.  You'd give out the new # as your fax #.
A device would measure the length of rings.  When it
detects a short ring, it turns off your answering machine.
Five rings later your fax picks up the call.

This should be cheaper and more elegant than the $80
switches now available.

But that's not what I did.  I'm giving out the new
# to my friends and customers.  This should leave the
old # for telemarketers, etc.  I won't pick up the
phone when I hear the long rings.

Here's one I hope some knowledgeable readers will make a comment or
contribution to:

In the State of Virginia radar detectors are illegal, period.  If
you are caught with one it will be confiscated on the spot and will
not be returned until after you appear in court and pay your fine. 
The fine for having a radar detector accessible in a motor vehicle
(even if it is not on) is $250.00.  Sorry, tourist, ignorance of
the law is no excuse - they will get you too!

It used to be that the only way the law could be enforced was for
an officer to actually see the radar detector.  Not any more!  Many
law enforcement agencies are now using radar detector detectors. 
Right, a super sensitive receiver that is capable of picking up RF
from the radar detector itself.  My first reaction was "no way!" 
But, guess again, these little buggers really work and the police
are writing citations right and left for people using radar
detectors.  One news story quoted an officer as saying that he had
found the radar detector in all of the cars he stopped except one,
and he could never figure out where it was - but he knew it was
there.  This tends to make one assume there are few false arrest.

Now, before I get flamed, please understand that I do drive at or
near the speed limit.  I do not need a radar detector to keep me
from getting a speeding ticket.  But, I do like to know when my
speed is being clocked or a speed trap is functioning.  My radar
detector now stays locked in my trunk when I am in Virginia (which
is what they want - and yes, what the law says, and I intend to
obey the law!) and is only used in states where it is legal.

For my fellow hams, I am not a microwave person - my mind only
works in the HF spectrum between 10 and 80 meters.  Microwave
enlightment may be necessary.

So, the questions are -
  What do the radar detector detectors actually detect?
  Would additional shielding/grounding/bypassing shield stray RF generated by
  a radar detector, or is the RF actually being emitted by the detector
  antenna?
  Are any brands "quieter" than others?

Some people pay shares that are more "fair" than others, and will continue
to do so, even with the presence of President Clinton.  Until the rich 
elite *hurt* from taxes and shower me with their blood dripping from the
wound of the tax dagger, I will scream and yell.  Because, taxes are

It's been 80 days.  Do you know where your wallet is?

Slick Willy's already got his hand in my pocket.  I'm just afraid
of what he might grab hold of.


Why do spacecraft have to be shut off after funding cuts.  For
example, Why couldn't Magellan just be told to go into a "safe"
mode and stay bobbing about Venus in a low-power-use mode and if
maybe in a few years if funding gets restored after the economy
gets better (hopefully), it could be turned on again.  

For that matter, why exactly were the Apollo lunar experiments
"turned off" rather than just "safed".  Was it political (i.e.
as along as they could be used, someone would keep bugging
congress for funds)?  Turning them off keeps them pesky
scientists out of the bureaucrat's hair....  

I've heard the argument that an active but "uncontrolled"
spacecraft causes "radio noise."  I find that hard to believe
that this could be a problem in a properly designed "safe" mode.
This safe mode could be a program routine which causes the
spacecraft to go to least fuel using orientation, and once a
(week, month, year, whatever) attempts a signal lock on Earth.
At that time, if funding has been restored, the mission can
continue.  If no signal is recieved, the spacecraft goes back to
the safe mode for another time period. As we would know when the
spacecraft is going to try to contact Earth, we could be
prepared if necessary.  

As another a spacecraft could do at the attempted contact is
beam stored data towards Earth.  If someone can receive it,
great, if not, so it's lost and no big deal.
By making the time and signal location generally known, perhaps
someone in the world might be able and willing to intercept the
data even if they're not willing to contact the spacecraft.

I see this as being particularly useful for spacecraft which
could have an otherwise long life and are in or are going to
places which are otherwise unaccessible (Jupiter/Saturn Orbit,
exiting the solar system, etc).   

Perhaps those designing future spacecraft (Cassini, Pluto Flyby,
etc) should consider designing in a "pause" mode in case their
spacecraft gets the ax sometime in the future after completion of
the primary mission. Perhaps Mars Observer and Galilleo could
have some kind of routine written in for the post mission
"drift" phase.

So any holes in all this?

The Fluke 87 beeps at you if you try to take it out of a current measuring
range while there is still a lead plugged in to the current sense socket.

... this should solve your problem - unless you are in a noisy environment.

  I found it very interesting that Atlas depended on pressure to
maintain tank geometry....leads me to the question: ? have any 
of the SSTO concepts explored pressurized tankage such that the
launch configuration would be significantly different from the
reentry one?  I have long been facinated by pnumatic structures
as conceived and built by Frei Otto and others, a "ballon" tank
SSTO sounds very clever.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                              April 15, 1993
#1506

     Scientists at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory report the
successful flight of a balloon carrying instruments designed to
measure and study chemicals in the Earth's ozone layer.

     The April 3 flight from California's Barstow/Daggett Airport
reached an altitude of 37 kilometers (121,000 feet) and took
measurements as part of a program established to correlate data
with the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS).  

     The data from the balloon flight will also be compared to
readings from the Atmospheric Trace Molecular Spectroscopy
(ATMOS) experiment which is currently flying onboard the shuttle
Discovery.

     "We launch these balloons several times a year as part of an
ongoing ozone research program.  In fact, JPL is actively
involved in the study of ozone and the atmosphere in three
important ways," said Dr. Jim Margitan, principal investigator on
the balloon research campaign.  

     "There are two JPL instruments on the UARS satellite," he
continued.  "The ATMOS experiment is conducted by JPL scientists,
and the JPL balloon research provides collaborative ground truth
for those activities, as well as data that is useful in its own
right."

     The measurements taken by the balloon payload will add more
pieces to the complex puzzle of the atmosphere, specifically the
mid-latitude stratosphere during winter and spring. 
Understanding the chemistry occurring in this region helps
scientists construct more accurate computer models which are
instrumental in predicting future ozone conditions.

     The scientific balloon payload consisted of three JPL
instruments:  an ultraviolet ozone photometer which measures
ozone as the balloon ascends and descends through the atmosphere;
a submillimeterwave limb sounder which looks at microwave
radiation emitted by molecules in the atmosphere; and a Fourier
transform infrared interferometer which monitors how the
atmosphere absorbs sunlight. 

     Launch occurred at about noontime, and following a three-
hour ascent, the balloon floated eastward at approximately 130
kilometers per hour (70 knots).  Data was radioed to ground
stations and recorded onboard.  The flight ended at 10 p.m.
Pacific time in eastern New Mexico when the payload was commanded
to separate from the balloon.

     "We needed to fly through sunset to make the infrared
measurements," Margitan explained, "and we also needed to fly in
darkness to watch how quickly some of the molecules disappear."

     It will be several weeks before scientists will have the
completed results of their experiments.  They will then forward
their data to the UARS central data facility at the Goddard Space
Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland for use by the UARS
scientists.    

     The balloon was launched by the National Scientific Balloon
Facility, normally based in Palestine, Tex., operating under a
contract from NASA's Wallops Flight Facility.  The balloon was
launched in California because of the west-to-east wind direction
and the desire to keep the operation in the southwest.

     The balloons are made of 20-micron (0.8 mil, or less than
one-thousandth of an inch) thick plastic, and are 790,000 cubic
meters (28 million cubic feet) in volume when fully inflated with
helium (120 meters (400 feet) in diameter).  The balloons weigh
between 1,300 and 1,800 kilograms (3,000 and 4,000 pounds).  The
scientific payload weighs about 1,300 kilograms (3,000) pounds
and is 1.8 meters (six feet) square by 4.6 meters (15 feet) high.

     The JPL balloon research is sponsored by NASA's Upper
Atmosphere Research Program and the UARS Correlative Measurements
Program.

I hope I didn't award custody, Rich.  I purposely used "handle" in order to 
avoid doing so - i.e., that happens to be what religions do (of course there are
aberrations like "scientific" creationism).  I used "best" in part to indicate 
that science currently has a time of it with why and who, so these domains are
mostly ignored.  I also attempted to be brief, which no doubt confused the
matter.  As an aside, for science I should have written "how and when".  Nobody
seems to argue over what.

>Are they [theists, theologians] any better equiped to investigate the "who and 
>why" than magicians, astrologers, housewives [not being sexists], athiests or 
>agnostics.

Seems to me that the answer would vary from individual to individual.  I'm not
trying to be evasive on this, but from a societal perspective, religion works.
On the other hand, sometimes it is abused and misused, and many suffer, which
you know.  But the net result seems positive, this from the anthropological
perspective on human affairs.  You might call me a neo-Fruedian insofar as I 
think the masses can't get along without religion.  Not that generally they are 
incapable; they just don't, and for myriad reasons, but the main one seems to 
be the promise of immortality.  Very seductive, that immortality.  Therefore 
it seems that theologians are better equipped than the others you mention for 
dispensing answers to "who and why".  I suggest that this holds regardless of 
the "truth" in their answers to who and why simply because people believe.  
In the end, spiritual beliefs are just as "real" as scientific facts and 
explanation (CAUTION TO SOME: DO NOT TAKE THIS OUT OF CONTEXT).  

>Do you suggest that the "who and why" will forever be closed to scientific 
>investigation?

No.  In fact, I don't think it is closed now, at least for some individuals. 
Isn't there a group of theoretical physicists who argue that matter was 
created from nothing in a Big Bang singularity?  This approach might 
presuppose an absence of who and why, except that it seems it could be argued 
that something had to be responsible for nothing?  Maybe that something doesn't
have to be supernatural, maybe just mechanistic.  But that's a tough one for
people today to grasp.  In any case, theory without empirical data is not 
explanation, but then your question does not require data.  In other words, 
I agree that theorizing (within scientific parameters) is just as scientific 
as explaining.  So the answer is, who and why are not closed to scientists, but 
I sense that science in these realms is currently very inadequate.  Data will 
be necessary for improvement, and that seems a long way off, if ever.  Pretty 
convoluted here; I hope I've made sense.  

>It seems to me that 200 or so years ago, the question of the origin of life on

I agree generally.  But I prefer to put it this way - the *questions* of how, 
when, who and why were not open to inquiry.  During the Enlightenment, 
reason was reponsible for questioning the theological answers to how and when, 
and not, for the most part, who and why.  Science was thus born out of the 
naturalists' curiosity, eventually carting away the how and when while largely 
leaving behind the who and why.  The ignorant, the selfish, the intolerant, and
the arrogant, of course, still claim authority in all four domains.

Much obliged.  Funny how facts tend to muddle things, isn't it?  Well, I am
sure there are plenty of "scientific" creationist "rebuttals" out there 
somewhere, even if they have to be created from nothing.

Hi,
	I am looking for some help in choosing a package
for a high-speed silicon ADC (100Mhz) currently being 
fabricated. This is a PhD research project and I have to test
the chip at speed on a PCB. I expect to have roughly 100
packaged circuits and will do DC, low-speed and high-speed
testing using 3 different set-ups for the test chip.
 	
	I know for sure that a DIP will not work
(the long lead lines have too high an inductance).
Getting a custom-made package is too expensive, so
I am trying to choose between a flatpak and a
leadless chip carrier. The flatpack would be hard
to test since it has to be soldered on to the test
setup and I would spend loads of time soldering 
as I kept changing the test chip. The leadless chip
carrier sockets also have long lead lines and may
not work at high speeds.
 
	Does anyone out there have experience/knowledge
of this field ? I would greatly appreciate help! Any ideas/
names of companies manufacturing holders/sockets/packages
would help. 
 
P.S. The multi-layer fancy GaAs packages seem like a bit
of overkill(?)

In principle, any star resembling the Sun (mass, luminosity) might have planets
located in a suitable orbit. There several within 100 ly of the sun. They are
single stars, for double or multiple systems might be troublesome. There's a
list located at ames.arc.nasa.gov somewhere in pub/SPACE. I think it is called

  Unfortunately, it's not that simple.  The KJV is preferred by the majority
of fundamentalists (at least here).  The second part of your argument fails
as well, since that statement can be used against any version (not just the
KJV).

  I would not find this statement to be very useful since it is an appeal
to authority and the opposition will just claim that their authorities are
"better".  A second tact that local creationists have used is to reply "but
those scholars are atheists and cannot be believed" (they will also use this
phrase to describe any theologians that they don't agree with).

  The verse being discussed clearly claims that sympathetic magic works (i.e.
placing stripped sticks in the cattle breeding grounds causes stripped and
spotted calves to be born) and should be attacked on that basis (no biologist
has ever observed this claimed correlation).

Garrett, you are a really pathetic liar.

Some of your charges are arguable, but most of them are obvious lies.

I challenge you to present us with any evidence that Nixon stole,
rigged a national election, never mind elections, or used the powers
of his office for personal gain.

You can't because there is absolutely no evidence that any of these

Not to worry.  The Masons have been demonized and harrassed by almost 
every major Xian church there is.  For centuries now.  And still they 
stand.  They wil withstand the miserable Southern Boobtists, I am sure.
They may even pick up a little support as people start to listen to the 
Boobtists and realize that subtracting the obvious lies and claims of 
Satanism that the Masons sound pretty good by comparison.  One thing is 
known.  A sizable proportion of Southern Babtists are Masons!  And the 
Masons have already fired back in their own magazines against the 
Boobtist Witch-hunt.
  Since the Consrervatives have already been a divisive element with 
their war on Boobtist moderates and liberals, they may now start in on 
their Mason/Boobtist brothers and hasten their own downfall as more and 
more Southern Boobtists realize their church can't stand being run by a 
handful of clowns looking for holy civil wars and purity tests and drop 
'em out of the leadership positions they have taken over.
  So as far as I am concerned, the louder, ruder, and more outrageous 
an Anti-Masonic Crusade these old goats mount, the better.

Pop some pocorn and get a center row seat.  The circus is about to begin.
And, Oh Look!  HERE COME THE CLOWNS!

	Per gallon (bushel) perhaps. Unfortunately they eat the same amount
every day no matter how much you ride them. And if you don't fuel them they
die. On an annual basis, I spend much less on bike stuff than Amy the Wonder
Wife does on horse stuff. She has two horses, I've got umm, lesseee, 11 bikes.
I ride constantly, she rides four or five times a week. Even if you count 
insurance and the cost of the garage I built, I'm getting off cheaper than 
she is. And having more fun (IMHO).

How hard would it be to somehow interface them to some of the popular

starting to get into them for some of my projects.  I have several 256k
SIMMs laying around from upgraded Macs and if I could use them as "free"

Well, it's not an FTP site, but I got an 800 number for Signetics BBS.

The Signetics BBS contain some pretty good items for the 8051.  I am

    tutor51.zip       TSR for 8051 feature help screens
    
They have lots of coding examples, assemblers, and misc. tools.

This rumor didn't happen to appear on April 1st?

If this DigiKey rep was serious, I think I will buy my parts elsewhere.
If that is the way they do business, you cannot trust them.

Taft Electronics, 45th Street between 5th & 6th -- the only one left in
what was once an entire district of electronics stores.  A little expensive.

Trans-Am Electronics, Canal Street near 7th Ave -- lots of surplus type

Several other electronics or "surplus" type places are still on Canal
Street.

I think Bronx Wholesale Radio is still in business -- Fordham Road not
too far from Arthur Avenue in the Bronx.  Also in the Bronx is NorthEastern
(or was it Northwestern?  Northeast Electronics?) on Jerome Avenue near

I once read an article on  Computer technology  which stated that 
every new computer technology was actually lower and slower then what it
replaced.  Silicon was less  effective then the germanium  products
then available.   GaAs  was less capable then Silicon.  Multi-processors
were slower then  existent single processors.

What the argument was, though was that these new technologies promised either
theoretically future higher performance  or lower cost or higher densities.

I think that the DC-1  may g=fit into this same model.

ELV's can certainly launch more weight  then  a SSRT,  but 
an SSRT offers the prospect of  greater cycle times and  lower costs.

This is kind of a speculative posting,  but I thought i'd throw it out as
a hjistorical framework  for those interested in the project.

somewhere.  I just saw the trickle down, thought it was intensely
stupid,  not knowing anything about the joke, mentioned arbitron
and left it with an equally stupid joke.  Bill in his ever increasing

I myself think the arbitron stats are  severely methodologically impaired,

Christian anti-Semitism comes from the obvious fact that the Jews should
know the Hebrew Scriptures better than anyone else, yet they did not
convert to Christianity en mass, thus rejecting "Christian Love."

I don't see why not. Where are the rest of the tribal people? What
happened to the tribes of the Americas? Culture is seen as different and
undesirable in the West, particular in the US with its failed "melting
pot concept." Most tribes have been hunted to extinction, the Hebrew
tribe is one of the few survivers from the Neolithic. Of course it
becomes difficult at times to separate Christianity from the Western
experience, so perhaps you are right, perhaps it would have been a better 
world if the cultural experiment in Christianity never happened.

Well, my driveway is... Just keep an eye out for the blue GLH Turbo that 
utilizes the "hit-the-ground-running" merging technique. 
At least I don't have a dog that you need worry about.

Last week while entering a sand/gravel covered intersection in the country, 
I caught something unkosher out of the corner of my eye (you know that 
disgusting sensation when great, as-of-yet unidentified, evil is about to 
intimately acquaint itself with you-- kind of like knowing that that darkening 
shadow around you just cannot possibly be anything even remotely good, because
it probably has something to do with a Boeing 747 behaving, gravitationally
speaking, much like a brick).  Negotiating my way into this intersection that 
somehow reminded me of Daytona beach (sans H2O, sun, & babes) I manage to get a
glance at my impending destiny.  Lucifer's own DOG.  Hell's secret blend
of canine-- Doberman and Rottweiler (it moved with the grace of a Doberman,
yet had the hulk and jowels of the Rottweiler-- a creature with a definite
*wrong* end to be at).  The picture in my mirrors was fuzzy, but there was no 
mistaking the fangs and saliva trail.  
To shorten a verbose tale, my burly gaurdian-angels once again performed above
and beyond the call of duty, carried the bike through the sand-trap (I honestlyhave no idea how), and left the minion of Beelzebub with a face that 
suspiciously resembles a Metzler tread.  No blood, though-- Rats.

Moral: I'm not really sure, but more and more I believe that bikers ought 
       to be allowed to carry handguns.

Ok lets have some calculation here: Going by Australian standards, which I 
presume might be similar to other countries ( If not, lets have some 
input) a phone uses 600ohm to loop a 48V line = 80mA. A standard LED 
drains 20mA. So what is the actual loop current required for an "off hook"

I have an '89 Kawasaki KX 80.  It is in mint condition and starts on the first
kick EVERY time.  I have outgrown the bike, and am considering selling it.  I
was told I should ask around $900.  Does that sound right or should it be
higher/lower?
    Also, I am looking for a used ZX-7.  How much do I have to spend, and what
year should I look for to get a bike without paying an arm and a leg????
    Thanks for the help!

From the "JPL Universe"
April 23, 1993

Cosmologist Stephen Hawking tours Lab

By Karre Marino
     Some 15 years after his first visit to JPL, Prof. Stephen
Hawking, Lucasian professor of mathematics at Cambridge
University and author of "A Brief History of Time," returned to
the Lab April 5.
     On a tour hosted by JPL Chief Scientist Dr. Moustafa Chahine
and Merle McKenzie, manager of the International Affairs Office,
Hawking visited a variety of facilities, met with Lab Director
Dr. Edward Stone and various project scientists and managers, and
felt "like royalty," he said. Hawking, whose theories attempt to
explain the origin of distant galaxies, black holes and alternate
dimensions, wanted to re-visit JPL, he explained, "because while
I'm most interested in those things in space that are farther
away, I know that here is where the first steps are taken."
     Hawking, who was accompanied by his family, two graduate
students and his aides, began the tour in von Karman Auditorium,
as David Evans, deputy assistant Lab director in the Office of
Flight Projects, and Dr. Arden Albee, Mars Observer's project
scientist, briefed him on current and past flight projects.
     Voyager was pointed out to him, with special attention paid
to a gold plate with a series of engraved images. Should
extraterrestrial life stumble upon the spacecraft, Evans noted,
they would find a variety of images that would explain something
of Earth. The professor asked if we were still communicating with
the spacecraft, and Evans affirmed that we are.
     Using a model of Mars Observer, Albee spent several minutes
describing the project and the spacecraft's features. In answer
to a question from Hawking, Chahine described a proposed
drag-free satellite, but confirmed that at this point, "it's only
a concept." Chahine, who had met Hawking at Caltech about five
years before, described the professor as "a living miracle of the
power of the brain. He's miraculous, and he has such a good sense
of humor."
     The next stop, a demonstration on scientific data
visualization in Section 384's Digital Image Animation Lab,
entertained and delighted the group, as everyone donned goggles
to view 3-D images of Mars. Project Scientist Dr. Eric De Jong
showed off the latest data -- a comet that had only recently been
discovered in orbit close to Jupiter. Hawking was curious about
its composition, and as he was shown how images are developed, he
asked several questions on their interpretation.
     Norman Haynes, ALD, Office of Telecommunications and Data
Acquisition, briefed the professor on the Space Flight Operations
Facility, and then Hawking spoke with Stone.
     The day ended with two technical discussions of particular
interest to the professor. Technical Group Leader Dr. Frank
Estabrook and Senior Research Scientist Hugo Wahlquist described
a three-spacecraft gravity wave experiment, currently under way.
Then planetary astronomer Dr. Richard Terrile explained the
philosophy and plans for extra solar system planetary detection.
     The Hawking party, which had been visiting Southern
California for five weeks, was headquartered at Caltech, and
planned to leave for England within a few weeks after the Lab
tour. Upon departing, the Cambridge-based scientist promised
Chahine that he would return to JPL for another visit.

Oddly, enough,  The smithsonian calls the lindbergh years
the golden age of flight.  I would call it the granite years,
reflecting the primitive nature of it.  It was  romantic,
swashbuckling daredevils,  "those daring young men in their flying
machines".  But in reality, it sucked.  Death was a highly likely
occurence,  and  the environment blew.  Ever see the early navy
pressure suits,  they were modified  diving suits.  You were ready to
star in "plan 9 from outer space".   Radios  and Nav AIds were
a joke,  and engines ran on castor oil.  They  picked and called aviators
"men with iron stomachs",  and it wasn't due to vertigo.

Oddly enough, now we are in the golden age of flight.  I can hop the
shuttle to NY for $90 bucks,  now that's golden.

Mercury gemini, and apollo were romantic,  but let's be honest.
Peeing in bags,  having plastic bags glued to your butt everytime
you needed a bowel movement.  Living for days inside a VW Bug.
Romantic,  but not commercial.   The DC-X  points out a most likely
new golden age.  An age where  fat cigar smoking business men in
loud polyester space suits will fill the skys with strip malls
and used space ship lots.

hhhmmmmm,  maybe i'll  retract that golden age bit.   Maybe it was
better in the old days.  Of course, then we'll have  wally schirra
telling his great grand children, "In my day,  we walked on the moon.
Every day.  Miles.  no buses.  you kids got it soft".

The problem is, you can't raise adequate amounts of money that way.
The Viking Fund tried.  They did succeed, in a way, but only because
of the political impact of their fundraising.  The actual amount of
money they raised was fairly inconsequential; it would not have kept
the Viking lander going by itself.

------------------------------------------------------------------


   		 NINETEENTH LETTER  

		 MU'JIZAT-I AHMEDIYE RISALESI 
(A TREATISE ON THE MIRACLES OF MUHAMMAD SAW)       
(SAW: PEACE AND BLESSINGS BE UPON HIM)

In His Name (ALLAH) , Be He (ALLAH) Glorified!
There is Nothing But Glorifies His (ALLAH's) Praise.

In The Name Of  Allah, The Compassionate, The Merciful

   "He is who has sent His Messenger with
guidance and the religion of truth  to make it
supreme over all religion:  and sufficient is Allah
as a Witness.  Muhammad is the Messenger of
Allah, and those who are with him are firm
against the unbelievers and merciful among
each other.  You will see them bowing and
prostrating  themselves, seeking Allah's grace
and His pleasure.  Their mark is on their face
the sing of prostrafion; this is their similitude in
the Torah and Indgil." [the Our'an 48:28-29]

   Since the Nineteenth and Thirhy-first Words
concerning the mission of Muhammad (SAW) prove his
prophethood with decisive evidences, we assign the
verification of that subject to those Words.
   As a supplement to them, we will merely show here
in Nineteen Signs, some  of the flashes of that great
truth.

   FIRST SIGN:  The Owner and Master of this universe
does everything with knowledge, disposes every affair
with wisdom, directs everything all-seeingly, treats
everything all-knowingly, and arranges in everything with
His will and wisdom such causes, purposes and uses that
are apparent to us.  Since the One who creates knows,
surely the One who knows will speak, since He will
speak, surely He will speak to those who have
consciousness, thought, and speech.  Since He will speak
to those who have thought, surely He will speak to
humankind, whose make-up and awareness are more
comprehensive of all conscious beings.  Since He will
speak to humankind, surely He will speak to the most
perfect of mankind and those most worthy of address and
highest in morality, and who are qualified to guide
humanity; then He will certainly speak to Muhammad (SAW), 
who, as friend and foe alike testify, is of the highest 
character and morality, and who is obeyed by one fifth
of humanity, to whose spiritual rule half of the globe has
submitted, with the radiance of whose light has been
illumined the future of mankind for thirteen centuries, to
whom the believers, the luminous segment of humanity,
renew their oath of allegiance five times a day, for
whose happiness and peace they pray, for whom they call
down Allah's blessings and bear admiration and love in
their hearts.

   Certainly, He will speak to Muhammad (SAW),
and Indeed He has done so;  He will make him the
Messenger, and Indeed He has done so; He will make
him the guide for the rest of humanity, and Indeed He
has done so.

The down side is that when I'm in my cage, I have on numerous occasions
slammed my hand into the rolled up window in an effort to wave at
a passing biker.  Ow.

Do you get a dial tone when you plug a phone into the jack??  If not,
then the line is possibly disconnected from the nearest telco junction
box. If you do get a dial tone, then surely the telco is sending a bill
for the line to *someplace* or *somebody*. Are you sure that what you
are doing is on the level. Sounds to me like you are just trying to get 
at somebody's unlisted number.  Fess up.

I sometimes wonder if your newsfeed gives you different articles than
everyone else, Pat.  Just a *few* corrections:

1) I never 'defended' 20kHz power, other than as something reasonable
to GO LOOK AT.

2) I have also never opposed a *research project* into feasibility of
the spalling reactor approach to 'cleaning' nuclear waste -- I simply
doubt it could be made to work in the Real World (tm), which ought to
become clear fairly quickly during a research program into feasibility
(sort of like what happened to 20 kHz power -- it proved to have a
down-side that was too expensive to overcome).

I figure 2 things wrong in a single sentence is a high enough fault
density for even you, Pat.

I hate to pour cold water on this, but currently seawater extracted
uranium, even using the new, improved fiber absorbers from Japan, is
about 20 times more expensive than uranium on the spot market.
Uranium is *very* cheap right now, around $10/lb.  Right now, there
are mines closing because they can't compete with places like Cigar
Lake in Canada (where the ore is so rich they present safety hazards
to the mines, who work in shielded vehicles).  Plenty of other sources
(for example, uranium from phosphate processing) would come on line before
uranium reached $200/lb.

"Demand and supply balance will collapse" is nonsense.  Supply and
demand always balance; what changes is the price.  Is uranium going
to increase in price by a factor of 20 by the end of the century?
Not bloody likely.  New nuclear reactors are not being built
at a sufficient rate.

Uranium from seawater is interesting, but it's a long term project, or
a project that the Japanese might justify on grounds of
self-sufficiency.

As a libertarian (with a small l) who voted for Clinton, I think that he
should abolish the Selective Service and the draft.  If his conscience
forbade him to go to war in Vietnam, it should forbid him to perpetuate
this system of government-sanctioned slavery.

If our government would pay attention to SERIOUS domestic issues (the ECONOMY)
and choose to stay out of other people's wars (Iraq, Bosnia, Somalia),
we would not be in this fix.  An anyway, couldn't the jobs be replaced by
improving our domestic situation?  (I'm not for continued deficit spending,
but if Clinton and Congress want to spend, I'd rather they improve the 
infrastructure than fight other people's wars.)

A novel idea:  Getting away from naval bases, what about refurbishing
decommissioned Air Force bases as airports?  This would be SO much cheaper
than building them from the ground up (Denver's new airport is one of the 
most appalling examples of pork-barreling and cronyism I have seen in
my lifetime).  Even if no more airports are needed, I'm sure Bill Gates
or Ross Perot would LOVE to have their own private airfields, and the
money from their purchases could be applied to the public debt.

Some say it was generated by God or Goddess; some say it was the result of
the coalescence of billions of tons of interstellar debris.  In either case,
the property of which Xavier speaks has been around for millions of years.

Oh?  When did She *stop*?  Mother Nature has been automatically providing
us with her bounty ever since we crawled out of the primordial ooze.  It

example, I saw four deer crossing the road (pretty sight, too); in an

The American Indians had no concept of ownership of property, and often
freely gave of their supplies to neighboring tribes, trading food and
clothing for weapons or services.  The Native Hawaiians, like their
Polynesian ancestors, also could not conceive of that idea, and shared
many things with the other Islanders.  In fact, "hi'ipoi", the Hawaiian
word for "cherish" means "sharing food".  The Great Mahele, in which
the Islands were divided up more-or-less evenly between the rich and
the poor, was a white man's idea.  In Africa, villagers will often
share tools, crops, and clothing with other members of their own village
and neighboring villages.  Every anthropologist who has ever been to
Africa has at least one tale of the difficulties arising from the so-
called "theft" of the scientists possessions -- two concepts of which,
until the visitors came along, the natives had no understanding.

These are the people we call "savages".

On the other hand, car-jackings and muggings are up from last year.

Dov, before you make further comment on this thread, I think it would

Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law. [Honestly.]
The word of Sin is Restriction. [Would I kid you?]


Does one man's words encompass the majestic vision of thousands
of individuals?  Quoting a man is not the same as quoting the
Order.  Taken out of context, words can be interpreted much
differently than had one applied them within the confines of
their original expression.

I think this is the case regarding Hymenaeus Beta, Frater Superior 
of the Order to which I belong.  When he included that bit
from Merlinus X' he did us all a service.  He showed us the extremes
to which Order members have been known to go in their fervor.
I have little knowledge regarding Reuss' background, but surely
he was an unusual man, and he was an important force in the Order 
for many years.

Yet as people change so do Orders change, and while we look back
so carefully at the dirty laundry of O.T.O. remember that this is
only the surface skim and that many perspectives are now encompassed
which extend beyond any one individual.  I hope to show that there
was and is much room for a difference of opinion within the Order
itself, perhaps by testing the limits myself.


Let us examine this issue a bit more closely....

"In 1895, Karl Kellner (1850-1905), a wealthy Austrian industrialist
and paper chemist, as well as a high-grade Mason, founded the Ordo
Templi Orientis.  Kellner had traveled widely in the East, where he
met three adepts who instructed him specific magical practices.  
Kellner's efforts to develop the Order were later assisted by Franz
Hartmann, Heinrich Klein and Theodore Reuss, who had worked together
prior to joining the O.T.O.  The Order was first proclaimed in 1902
in Reuss's Masonic publication, 'Oriflamme'.  On Kellner's death,
Reuss succeeded him as Outer Head [O.H.O.].  The 'Jubilee' edition of
the 'Oriflamme', published in 1912, announced that the Order taught
secret of sexual magic.
 
"Theodore Reuss was an interesting character.  Born June 28, 1855 in
Augsburg, he entered Masonry in 1876.  He was a singer, journalist and
possibly a spy for the Prussian political police, infiltrating the Socialist
League founded by Karl Marx's daughter and her husband.  Reuss was
later associated with William Wynn Westcott, a leader of the Golden
Dawn, who later introduced him to John Yarker.  Yarker chartered Reuss to
found the Rites of Memphis and Mizraim in Germany.  After several
attempts to concretize various Masonic Rites, Reuss settled on the
development of the O.T.O.

"The Order experienced reasonably steady growth under Reuss' leadership.
For example, he chartered Papus in France, Rudolph Steiner in Berlin
and H. Spencer Lewis in the USA.  In 1912, the historic meeting between
Reuss and Crowley occurred.  Crowley wrote that Reuss came to him and
accused him of revealing Order secrets.  When Crowley looked at it afresh,
the initiated interpretation of sexual magick unfolded itself to him for
the first time.  Reuss appointed Crowley as Supreme and Holy King of all
the English speaking world, and it was this authorization that he invoked
when publishing the material of the Equinox.

"Reuss resigned as Outer Head of the Order in 1922 after suffering a
stroke and named Crowley his successor.  All was well until 1925 when
_The Book of the Law_ was translated into German.  There was a break
in the continuity of the Order.  Manyk members split with the new O.H.O.
over the book, which Crowley was actively promulgating through the Order.
He had earlier revise dthe Order rituals at Reuss's request, deeply
infusing the doctrines of the New Aeon revelation."

_An Introduction to the History of the O.T.O._, by Ad Veritatem IX'

Within _Equinox III:10_, Edited by 
  Hymenaeus Beta, Frater Superior, Rex Summus Sanctissimus,
    Caliph of the United States of America,
      Published by Samuel Weiser, 1990.



There are many possible reasons that our Frater Superior included this
material in _Equinox III:10_.  And this is the real point, is it not?
Why did he wish to publish such things about the history of his own
organization?  Does he represent a dogmatic threat to the principle
of Thelema?  Or is he exercising his True Will and putting forth very
complex pictures with no easy answers?  A picture which leaves room
for very many interpretations.

It is quite easy for me to see, for example, that all of O.T.O. derived
out of the dribble of faltering Masonry, purchased by clever hucksters
with an ounce of courage and some writing ability to aid them.  And I
can take that all the way down to our present Caliph, whose feeble
support of the 'Law of Thelema' is laughable at best.

Would I be thrown out of the Order for speaking in this way?  
Will I?  
I think not.
Why?  Because my Frater will see it as a perspective, an interjection
I am using as an example.  My illustration shows that we may express things
in the context of a larger work and the true significance of this may be
quite difficult to apprehend at first.

So it may be with OTO and Merlinus X'.  Please look O.T.O. more carefully.
I do not support Reuss's words myself, as I am not qualified to assess
them, and I am critical of their pomposity.  If I who am a member of
the Order take such a stand and am allowed to continue doing so, then
what can this say about the health of the Order?  Does it mean that
the Order has 'gone soft' and abandoned its moral principles?  Or
does it mean that it is strong in its ability to let the will of
universal kinship arise on its own, not shackled by some dogmatic
requirement?  How shall we resolve these two possibilities?


I find a high calibre of individual associated with Ordo Templi Orientis.
They are often quite intelligent and sometimes very well versed in arcane
or usual information.  They are quite often artists and geniuses.  
Having met some 20 longstanding members in the SF Bay Area (many who are or
were very heavily involved with the Order), I can vouch for the integrity
of the organization as it stands.

I have sometimes questioned the policy of Hymenaeus Beta.  In these moments 
I followed my intuition, and I've found little to stop me from requesting
a Second initiation from a different O.T.O. body.  I'm happily participating
in social groups (Feasts or Initiations) and have come to know the Gnostic
Mass well enough for my tastes.
 

This doesn't make me an authority on Order politics and explanations, however.
I can only hypothesize and relay to you what I understand based on my
limited contact with other members.

I urge you not to take the words of Merlinus X too far.  There are many
ways to interpret words, and many people who have become involved with
the Order feel very strongly about the sanctity of personal freedom
and the preservation of individual vision.

I welcome other comment on this issue and will be writing more in response
to other posts in this thread.

I have two books, both NASA Special Publications, on the Voyager 
Missions. One is titled "Voyages to Jupiter" the other "Voyage to Saturn" 
These were excellent books put together after the encounters with each 
planet. 

The question is: Did NASA ever put together a similar book for either the 
Uranus encounter or Neptune? If so, what SP number is it and where can it 
be obtained? If not, why didn't they?

Did anyone catch the rocket that was launched with a movie advert 
all over it? I think the rocket people got alot of $$ for painting 
up the sides with the movie stuff. What about the Coke/Pepsi thing 
a few years back? NASA has been trying to find ways to get other 
people into the space funding business for some time. Frankly, I've 
thought about trying it too. When the funding gets tight, only the 
innovative get funded. One of the things NASA is big on is co-funding. 
If a PI can show co-funding for any proposal, that proposal has a SIGNIFICANTLY
higher probability of being funded than a proposal with more merit but no 
co-funding. Once again, money talks!

I would like to be able to detect the angular position (low accuracy) of an
IR emitting source at a distance of about 100 meters (more is better) in
daylight.  The IR source could be emitting a signature; I'm leaning toward
30 KHz square wave with 50% duty cycle.

I am considering the use of a quadrant detector from Centronic Inc. to give
information to a pan/tilt head to point the sensor and thus determine the
angles.  For the source I am considering wazing the heck out of an IR LED(s),
possibly an Optek OP290 or Motorola MLED81.  Wazing would mean at least 1 Amp
current pulses.  At this current the duty cycle of the LED drops to 10% and I
would need to cycle five of them in turn to get the 50% required.

Has anyone done something like this?

Be warned, it is not my job to convert you.  That is the job of
the Holy Spirit.  And I, frankly, make a lousy one.  I am only

The two commandments *are* rules; they are merely rules that are
so vague that they are practically devoid of meaning.  Michael
Siemon acknowledges this every time he writes that the resolution
of an argument over them turns on secular and cultural
assumptions that are independent of these rules.

The commandment to love your neighbor as yourself can be viewed,
in part, as reminding man that he is not God and cannot act as if
he has "ultimate responsibility." Indeed, many traditions present
an interpretation where believers are supposed to interpret
loving one's neighbor as following various other rules, and
relying on their god to make things come out right, precisely
because it would be wrong for man to assume such "ultimate
responsibility." Once again, we are confronted with good sounding
goo that means whatever the reader wants it to mean.

And who is to say that this interpretation is "twisted"?  There
are many passages in the Bible that in their most straightforward
reading show the Christian god behaving in just this way.
Michael cannot refer to "base" claims or base commandments to
show that such readings are "twisted," because this divergence in
understanding occurs even in trying to interpret the "base"
claims and commandments.  In addressing conservative Christians,
Michael will necessarily draw upon secular and cultural notions
that these conservative Christians will reject.

But these base commandments are too vague to serve as  "a
principle for the CRITIQUE of ethical systems." The meaning of
these base commandments for any believer derives from the secular
and cultural notions that the believer brings to them, from how
the believer mixes their demands with straightforward readings of
other Biblical passages, from a particular sectarian tradition,
or from some combination of these things.  These commandments
lack sufficient substance in themself to serve as a basis for
criticizing ethical systems.  What meaning they have comes from
the ethical system the believer brings to these commandments.

Jesus explicitly states that this summarizes Jewish law, which
would seem to bring in all of it if we properly understand what
it means to love God and love our neighbors.  There are *many*
parables and teachings the gospels attribute to Jesus that are
straightforwardly read as ethical commandments.  The Pauline
epistles are similarly full.  If it is not clear that these all
come together in a sensible understanding of ethical behavior,
the problem is *not* a lack of raw material. 

-*----
> I am a "radical" Christian *only* in that I take the gospel seriously.

No, Michael, the conservative Christians also take the gospel 
seriously.  What differentiates you is the way you interpret the
gospel.

> ... Why don't I and the (myriads of) other Christians like me
> tell you something about Christianity? ...

In a sense, the wide variety of interpretations does tell us
something about Christianity.  It tells us that the New Testament
authors left a sufficiently vague hodge-podge that it can serve
as the source text for many, vastly different beliefs about the
nature of the Christian god and about what men should and
shouldn't do. 

The irony here is that there is *nothing* in Christianity per
se that Michael can use to support the cause of lesbians and
gays.  *Every* Christian principle he turns to this cause is
effective only through the extra-Christian principles through
which Michael interprets his religion, and the homophobes apply
the *same* Christian principles, with equal justification, to
their cause.  In short, it is the extra-Christian principles that
make Michael's Christianity beneficial, and I suspect they would
be as beneficial, perhaps moreso, without being filtered by
Christian interpretation.  

Michael paints a picture of "standard American atheism" as the
rejection of the evil in many conservative Christian
interpretations of the Bible.  But I think it is even more
damaging to Christianity to note that the New Testament presents
such a vague hodge-podge of notions about the nature of God and
the nature of the good (except, of course, when it is ordered by
an interpretation that relies on extraneous principles).  Here, I
think we should apply a Christian parable, where a cold drink can
have its value and a hot drink can have its value, but the
lukewarm we should spit out.

First of all, realize that Tesla invented AC power generators, motors,
transformers, conductors, etc. Technically, *ALL* transformers are Tesla
coils.  In general though when someone refers to a Tesla coil, they mean
an "air core resonant transformer". The TV flyback version Tesla
coil (see the _Encyclopedia_of_Electronic_Circuits_ V3, 106-1 for
diagram) has NOT an air core. It is of a class of circuit called
"Oscillating Shuttle Circuit" (OSC). Generally OSC's are highly
efficient, but this version uses transistors and resistors,
which are very lossy devices. Typically Tesla used active
reactances instead of passive resistors, so that he could achieve
efficiencies of 99.5%, and better. The usual application of an air-core
resonant transformer, or of an OSC, is to produce strong EMI
for wireless broadcasts. How well do you think your computer
screen would work if we removed the HF HV Tesla (flyback) coil
from it? If we were to remove from our homes and industries all
Tesla coils, our lights would go dark, our cars would sputter
and die, our radios would go silent, our industries would grind
to a halt, and we would have to go back to using coal for heat,
gas for lamps, horses for transportation, steam for power, and
telegraph for communication. Is that real world enough for you???????

GET THE MESSAGE! WE WOULD NOT HAVE 1/100 THE CONVIENIENCES WE HAVE
TODAY IF NOT FOR TESLA. GIVE CREDIT WHERE CREDIT IS DUE!

If it had been up to Edison, we'd still be in the 19th century.
(flame me at your own peril. I'm very good at putting edison down).

Definately, I agree wholeheartedly.  If they can build the amp where

  components in and go to more effort to improve the design of the
  amplifier - as Adcom has done.

Sure, I didn't mean to imply that because of the heat generated, the
  amp sounds good.  My Adcom GFP 535II runs fairly warm - not hot to
  the touch - but enough to satisfy me that the amp is running nicely.
I don't like it when an amp runs dead-cold.  It makes one think that
  the amp is doing nothing :)
The heatsinks that Adcom uses in their amps are certainly far for
  skimpy - they're massive things with heating vents both below
  and above.  More than enough to carry away excessive heat.

My opinions once again.

Wow, what a concept!  Does anybody want to speculate on how this
"non-connection" would fit into the theft of cable services laws?
It seems to me that unless this case is specifically written into
the legislation that the cable company would not have a leg to
stand upon in court.

Does anybody out there have any specific legal knowledge on this?

Well, I guess I'm left wondering just who all the 'light fascists'
think *they* are.  Yes, I understand the issues.  I don't even
particularly care for the idea.  But am I the only one that finds the
sort of overreaction above just a *little* questionable?  You must
find things like the Moon *really* obnoxious in their pollution.

A few questions for those frothing at the mouth to ask themselves:

	1) How long is this thing supposed to stay up?  Sounds like it
would have a *huge* drag area, not a lot of mass, and be in a fairly
low orbit.

	2) Just what orbital parameters are we talking about here?
What real impact are we talking about, really?  How many optical
astronomers are *really* going to be impacted?

	3) Which is more important; adding a few extra days of
'seeing' for (very few) optical astronomers or getting the data the
sensors are supposed to return along with the data for large
inflatables (and the potential there for an inflatable space station)?
The choice would seem to be one or the other, since the advertising is
being used to help fund this thing.

	4) If your answer to 3) above was "the astronomers", then feel
free to come up with some other way to fund the (to my mind) more
important research data that would be gained by this WITHOUT SPENDING
ANY MORE OF MY MONEY TO DO IT.  In other words, put up or shut up.

If anyone is interested in the history of AMORC, I do think Spencer
Lewis published books about the beginning and his mission. The

The P&G pots are very good.  The Alps ones are usually carried by
