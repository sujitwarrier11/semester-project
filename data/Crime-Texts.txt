Well, isn't that interesting.  Dorothy Denning, Mitch Kapor, Marc
Rotenberg, Ron Rivest, Jim Bidzos, and others.  The Government, RSA,
TIS, CPSR, and the EFF are all represented.  I don't suppose anybody
within any of these organizations would care to comment?  Or is this
just the White House's idea of a cruel joke on these peoples' inboxes?

In light of my recent paranoia concerning government proposals, I'd love to
see a UNIX-based encryption scheme that:

1) Kept some files encrypted on the host machine (say, all the files in your
   home directory)
2) Used a key system that could not be compromised by eavesdropping over a
   modem line.

It seems that this would require modifications to a shell program and a
way of telling whether a file was encrypted or not, among other things.

I'd love to know about potential security holes in such a system.

Does such a system exist?  If it were made easy-to-use and readily
available, I think it would be a Good Thing(tm).  I realize that this
would probably just involve putting a nice front-end on a readily available
and very secure encryption scheme, but it should be done.

Thanks for the ear,
Brad

Hmm, my first thought was that they're using Diffie-Hellman exponential
session key exchange, or an equivalent.  However, the Diffie-Hellman
patent, like the Hellman-Merkle one on public key systems, claims
all equivalents, so the basic point stands.

Interestingly, a quote from Jim Bidzos showed up in the media real
soon after the announcement, and he sounded very pissed.  Maybe he hadn't
yet realized that PKP might have just struck gold?  All they have to
do is get someone to admit the general scheme that the Clipper uses.

Not at all. Two weeks ago I registered a concern about some programming
that was being conducted by a student organisation here at the
University of Texas at San Antonio.  As a result, I was interrogated
by the capus police, who also attempted to create a positive-identification
file (photo, fingerprints, etc.). I refused to permit this, and filed a
complaint with the University administration.  The Vice-President for
Business Affairs (the 'boss' of the campus police) stated that he had no
interest in the legal/Constitutional implications of those actions.

    No. The LAPD officers were tried first by the State of California
on charges of police brutality, and secondly by the Federal Government
on depriving RK of his civil rights - a different crime.

    The scenario I outline is more similar to the Oliver North trial.
Ollie confessed to treason (aiding an enemy of the US) during Senate
hearings, under immunity. The team which was later to prosecute him on
criminal charges had to sequester itself from all reports of ON's
immunized testimony. ON's lawyer brought up the probability that at
least someone on the team had heard about the Senate testimony, and it
was a strong factor against the prosecution, which is one of the
reasons this ON is still walking around free today.

If the data isn't there when the warrant comes, you effectively have
secure crypto.  If secret backups are kept...then you effectively have
no crypto.  Thus, this poster is essentialy arguing no crypto is better
than secure crypto.

If the data isn't there when the warrant comes, then the government will
just have to use normal law enforcement techniques to catch crooks.  Is
this so bad?   BTW, bugging isn't YET a normal law enforcement technique.
With the privacy clipper, it WILL become a normal technique.

As am I

If "high quality secure NSA classified technology" means handing my key
over to whomever, I'll take PGP any day.

Right now they are billing it as voluntary, i.e. bend over, here it comes.

As soon as enough Wiretap chip based units are out there, how much
easier do you think it will be to redefine "on your own" to mean
write it yourself and don't even THINK about distributing it...?

Get honest, no one is going to buy this trash if they KNOW it's compromised
already, and less will buy it if the algorithm is not disclosed.

The NSA knows that making this stuff available to the public means
handing it to whatever foreign powers are interested in the process.
Since when has export control stopped anyone (especially software wise)

Ask yourself carefully if " high quality secure NSA classified technology "
is something they are going to hand out.  Not unless you can drive a
NSA van through the holes.

We might get further if we begin by accepting that the government 
really couldn't be bothered less about the political opinions of the 
right wing pro establishment types. Just about the only circumstances 
in which I could think that they would be interested in their political 
views would be to recruit them as spooks. They can be guaranteed to give
the government line when it counts. In US history it has been the 
socialists such as myself who have been persecuted. 


Now before people start asserting that there is no mechanism by which
the administration can get their new chip adopted without legal force
lets try thinking.

In the first place the clipper chip must have existed for several years as
a defense project. Therefore this is not a party matter at all. George Bush
was in any case hardly adverse to tapping calls, he was chief spook 
remember.

Secondly the govt can quite easily apply pressure. They simply "ask" their
chums who they give huge defense contracts to (motorola etc) to be "nice"
boys. After all Bill is giving them a nice little trade monopoly since the
chips won't be avaliable to foreign firms.

Thirdly the people who consider the Democrats to be socialist are not the
same as the ones who consider socialists to be communist. People might know
this if the US education system did not suffer from the Mcarthyite and 
Dewy version of political correctness - the sort with tribunals and show 
trials. Ever seen Ed Meese pissed? I have, it was when he said that socialism
and communism were the same thing and brought the house down with laughter.
It took several minutes before we realised that he was serious.

     There are some issues which come to mind when one considers
the law enforcement aspects of the use of the Big Brother
(Clipper) chip.
     The drug dealers and terrorists aren't going to let
themselves be caught by using this type of encryption.  In 1985
the New York Times reported that government investigators broke
up a narcotics ring that was operating highly sophisticated
equipment capable of allowing the leaders of the ring to
eavesdrop on the law-enforcement agents who were trying to arrest
them.
     A Mr. Deely, an NSA official, said "There are a lot of
medium-sized countries that would have been proud to have the
signals intelligence operation of this group."
     For every John Gotti there are probably many more people who
have the sophistication to know what the risks of unsecure
communications are.  The press given to the Big Brother chip will
only increase their numbers.
     Even if there is some benefit to law-enforcement through the
use of Big Brother, it must be weighed against the constitutional
and civil liberties questions involved.
     For example, in some areas of the world torture is used as
an investigative tool by the local "law-enforcement" people.  I
suspect it is an effective means of obtaining information and
shortening many investigations.  It probably also helps keep the
conviction rate high.
     The fact that the torture tool is not used in this country
(even with a court order obtained by showing "probable cause") is
because we have rightly balanced the questions of expediency and
what is ethically and morally right.
     I think that the same question of expediency versus morality
should come into play when considering the use of Big Brother.  I
vote for morality.
     I am quite disturbed by what I interpret as a veiled threat
to prohibit the use of all encryption if this Big Brother chip is
not put into wide spread use.  After a quick reading of the White
House press release I came away with that impression.
     To most of the American public, the word "hacker" has
rightly or wrongly come to mean "high tech adolescent vandal".
It has struck me that most of the people posting to sci.crypt
regarding this issue are intelligent, thoughtful individuals who
have genuine concerns about the privacy and constitutional issues
surrounding Big Brother.  I hope that the use of Big Brother does
not become mandatory and other encryption become illegal.  I
would hate to see this become some kind of high tech Volstead
Act.
     The high speed digital communications revolution is coming
at us with the speed of an SST.  The times they are a changing,
and just as IBM is learning that they can't do business the same
way they have done it for the past 40 years, maybe NSA should
evaluate another approach.
     EFF, who have correctly questioned the cryptographic
strength of Big Brother, may need to send a stronger message out
regarding the constitutional issues involved.
     Al Gore may want to think this one through a little more.
     And as for Dorothy Elizabeth Robling Denning: En quoi cela
vous concerne, cheri?


   I was wanting to ask the same question Dan Bernstein asked--how does the
Clipper chip exchange keys?  If the public key is only 80 or 160 bits long,
does anyone know of any public-key schemes that are secure with that key
size?  (Diffie-Hellman or maybe El Gamal, with p set to a constant value?)
   Presumably, the real scheme is something like:
 
   1.  Exchange/verify public keys.
   2.  Send encrypted (randomly-generated) session key.
   3.  Encrypt / Decrypt voice trafic with some sort of fast stream cipher.
 
   Can anyone elaborate on this, or show me what I'm missing here?

With all the talk about this Clipper chip, I have developed one question...

			HOW DOES IT WORK???

If you use this, then how does it get decrypted on the other end? Does the
other party (receiving the phone call/mail/etc) have to know some code to 
undo it? Do I use a different method for calling one party than I would for 
another?. If the other party can decrypt it, doesn't that mean that someone
else could also? I assume that if everyone has a different key, the only use
would be storing secure data for later retrieval by the same key. This seems
like a fundamental question to me, but I have very little experience with
cryptosystems, other than DES. If someone could give me an explanation as
to how it would be used (remember that I have had little experience with
this sort of thing) it would be very much appreciated.

I don't know about classified, but I do seem to remember that unless

The NSA is now funding research not only in cryptography, but in all areas

Here are some ideas for those of you who want to oppose the White

tough measure to fight, since the Government has invested a lot of
resources in developing this high-profile initiative.  They are
serious about it now.  It won't be as easy as it was defeating Senate
Bill 266 in 1991.

Possible actions to take in response:

1)  Mobilize your friends to to all the things on this list, and
more.

2)  Work the Press.  Talk with your local newspaper's science and
technology reporter.  Write to your favorite trade rags.  Better yet,
write some articles yourself for your favorite magazines or
newspapers.  Explain why the Clipper chip initiative is a bad idea. 
Remember to tailor it to your audience.  The general public may be
slow to grasp why it's a bad idea, since it seems so technical and
arcane and innocent sounding.  Try not to come across as a flaming
libertarian paranoid extremist, even if you are one. 

3)  Lobby Congress.  Write letters and make phone calls to your
Member of Congress in your own district, as well as your two US
Senators.  Many Members of Congress have aides that advise them of
technology issues.  Talk to those aides.

4)  Involve your local political parties.  The Libertarian party
would certainly be interested.  There are also libertarian wings of
the Democrat and Republican parties.  The right to privacy has a
surprisingly broad appeal, spanning all parts of the political
spectrum.  We have many natural allies.  The ACLU.  The NRA.  Other
activist groups that may someday find themselves facing a government
that can suppress them much more efficiently if these trends play
themselves out.  But you must articulate our arguments well if you
want to draw in people who are not familiar with these issues.

4)  Contribute money to the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) and
Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility (CPSR), assuming
these groups will fight this initiative.  They need money for legal
expenses and lobbying.

5)  Mobilize opposition in industry.  Companies that will presumably
develop products that will incorporate the Clipper chip should be
lobbied against it, from within and from without.  If you work for a
telecommunications equipment vendor, first enlist the aid of your
coworkers and fellow engineers against this initiative, and then
present your company's management with a united front of engineering
talent against this initiative.  Write persuasive memos to your
management, with your name and your colleagues' names on it.  Hold
meetings on it.

6)  Publicize, deploy and entrench as much guerrilla
techno-monkeywrenching apparatus as you can.  That means PGP,
anonymous mail forwarding systems based on PGP, PGP key servers,
etc.  The widespread availability of this kind of technology might
also be used as an argument that it can't be effectively suppressed
by Government action.  I will also be working to develop new useful
tools for these purposes. 

7)  Be prepared to engage in an impending public policy debate on
this topic.  We don't know yet how tough this fight will be, so we
may have to compromise to get most of what we want.  If we can't
outright defeat it, we may have to live with a modified version of
this Clipper chip plan in the end.  So we'd better be prepared to
analyze the Government's plan, and articulate how we want it
modified.

Maybe I don't know enough to know what I am asking, but with millions
of these things about, how could the algorythm possibly stay secret?
Couldn't some clever hackers just grind the thing down layer by layer,
and see how it worked?

It just occurred to me why the algorithm is secret.  If it were
published, one could then build physically identical clone versions
of the chip that would interoperate with official Clipper chips.  But
the cloner wouldn't provide the keys to the escrow houses.  Hmmn.

Or is there a technical hack that I've missed?  E.g. how about if the
chips were made unprogrammed but serialized, and then shipped to the
two escrow houses who programmed in their halves of the keys, but
in a way that requires that secret keys known only to the escrow houses
be installed as well, without which clone versions wouldn't
interoperate?  This is getting awfully complicated, but that's
crypto for you.

  And in Russia, capitalists were persecuted for trading goods on the
black market. And in the US, capitalist minded types are imprisoned and killed
for things such as selling drugs, guns, pornography, and other victimless
activities.  It doesn't matter whether you are socialist or capitalist,
power and control are central to government. Since citizens can't be trusted to
run their own affairs, the government must watch them.  (for their
own good of course. I mean, with strong cryptography, citizens might <gasp!>
start to hide things from the IRS, sell drugs/guns/pornography, and
that cannot be allowed!)

  Not very surprising to anyone who believes in "hands off" government. If
you believe that your private life (both social and financial) are none of
anyone else's business, the difference between socialism and communism is
like the difference between murder by lethal injection or by
chainsaw. The more centralized the economy is, the more potential
abuses for accumulation of information on individuals. If you think
credit companies are bad, ...  Well, I'm sure a democratic socialist society
would vote for absolute privacy of all citizens -- NOT!

Given the description of the algorithm given, the only plausible
explantion I can find is that K_P must be agreed to out of bandwidth
in advance by the two parties; i.e. it's a standard shared symmetric
key.

Well, as funny as your little comment may seem, it has very little to
do with your personal privacy as a citizen, and about the governemnt

at one point or another.

This "Clipper Chip" stuff is the seeds for nightmares to make the 
Nightmare on Elmstreet cheese-on-celluloid movies look like episodes
of Mr. Roger's Neighborhood.

IF the gov establishes a cryptography standard that has to be used by
everyone, and everyone's personal key is divided into two segments
and stored at two separate, albeit easy to find places, and that key is
only 80 bits to begin with, we are screwed (pardon the allusion to the 
affore-mentioned article)!

the gov, I believe, as do many others probably already have the cracking chips
for this Clipper Chip made.  Hell, they probably based the encoder on the 
chip that cracks it, that way it's easier to break the code, but since it is a 
classified algorythm, no one knows that they can crack it so easily.

I, for one, and quite scared of this kind of thing, and plan to support 
organizations (and even disorganizations) who are fighting against this
Clipper Chip in any way that I can.

I do not want the government to be able to have access, even with a search
warrant, to my keys... and I don't want those keys to be only 80 bits long
to begin with!

I envision incorporation of new standart into
various communication systems, thus making it prevalent on the market & 
therefore cheap. The way to do that may be detaching crypto chip from 
communication equipment. It seems logical to provide Clipper chip 
to the end-user not as a part of phone, fax, modem & like but in the
form of smart-card compatible with various telecomm. products. Banks 
will encourage extensive use of new cards to make transactions by phone.
Natural step will be to cross-reference this card to the person in the 
government databases - or else this new version of "wiretap proposal" 
make no sence at all; one wish to eavesdrop (spell.) on the particular 
person, not on the particular modem or phone.
 
As a side note, I disagree with one poster, who said he won't care about
ability of the government to eavesdrop, since they can do that now 
anyway. Clipper will take away electronic survelliance from citizens, 
making it monopoly of the government. May be, we can find examples when
interceptions made by (unauthorised) people uncovered crimes of 
state officials ?

Some thoughts:

Has any work been done on encapsulating encrypted data inside "non-encrypted"
data files?  Many file formats can be written with "gaps" in them to hide
other data.  New file formats could be designed to have alternate data hidden
by dispersing it amongst the "legitimate" data.  The hidden data would only
show up with the right key(s), and a file with hidden data would be
indistinguishable from one without.  So, only the correct key(s) would reveal
the presence of an "illegal" document.

If I devise a custom file compression algorithm and only I and a friend have
the uncompressor, and otherwise the file appears to be total gigerish, do I
have the right to transmit the file?  Will we have to "escrow" all our data
file formats?  Are gangs required to escrow their hand signals, colors and
catch phrases?

I think that it's important to evaluate the content of electronic speach by
replacing the media with pen and paper or verbal speach and then re-ask the
question.


I've recently moved from Unix to a DOS box and have a number of files 
that I used crypt to "protect".  Does anyone know of a DOS version of 
crypt?  I've found one, but it insists on six letter keys and I used 
some shorter ones.  Thanks for your help.  -- Doug

But, for all the wrongness of our attempt to correct it (VietNam, et. al.),
the domino theory wasn't disproved at all.


The cryptographic algorythm MUST be kept secret, or
private individuals could make ClipperClones with
which they could transmit messages which the feds would not have
ready access to.  This is clearly unacceptable.

I hope somebody starts doing this soon after the first

This is a very curious thing to say. STU-IIIs (NSA-designed secure
telephones cleared for classified traffic) are already readily
available to law enforcement agencies. Word has it they're standard in
every FBI office, for example.  Something like several hundred
thousand of these phones exist in all. They are clearly the US government
standard.

So why does the DoJ need to buy new phones that, unlike STU-IIIs, will
not be certified for classified traffic, and in all likelihood will
not be compatible with existing STU-IIIs?

Unless, of course, they're gearing up for large scale decryption of
civilian Clipper users, and they need compatible hardware...

dwight tuinstra posts a very interesting message in which he comments on the
effects of the Clipper chip on state and local police. Actually, reading
between the lines, it could be a very good thing for civil liberties in one
respect, since it will at least prevent cowboy cops and cowboy state and
local agancies from reading your traffic if they tap it illegally.

There has been extensive discussion in the eff forum, for example, about
inadmissible taps being used to develop information that could then lead to
admissible evidence.  This might put a stop to such things, which must from
time to time be simple fishing expeditions.

The description of the chip's operation evidently leaves out some of the
key management aspects.  Either the K_P is the secret key corresponding
to a public key which is broadcast at message initiation, or it is the
result of a Diffie-Hellman key exchange or something similar.  Either
way there must be some protocols beyond those described here.  It isn't
clear whether they are implemented in the Clipper wiretap chip or must
be provided by other system components.

Via K_P, of course.  Nothing was said about where K_P comes from.  It's
the session key, though, and it's chosen however you usually choose
session keys --- exponential key exchange, shared secret, RSA, etc.
But however you choose it, the chip will apparently emit the escrow
header when you do.

   I don't doubt that this will be the attitude of many corporate leaders.
It's understandable--most corporate execs don't know much about cryptology,
and it's easy to get taken in by someone peddling snake oil.  And, the
proposed scheme *is* a major improvement in telephone security to what
exists now.
 
   The problem is that, with any security scheme of this kind, you have to
concern yourself with the weakest link in the chain.  I suspect that NSA
has put a fairly strong encryption algorithm in this wiretap chip of theirs,
probably at least as strong as (say) DES in OFB-mode.  Unfortunately, the
existence of the key-registry system seems to make possible all kinds of
possible attacks at a small fraction of the expense of trying to build (say)
a DES keysearch machine.
 
   As originally described, it sounded like any police / court combination
could acquire the key for a given chip.  I hope that's not the case, since
it would imply a glaring hole.  (How much does it cost to find *one* crooked
jodge and *one* crooked cop?  Especially for a foreign intelligence agency
or organized crime boss?)  However, even if more intelligent schemes are used
to allow access to the unencrypted phone conversations, there will be weak-
nesses.  They may be very expensive, and very difficult.  But who would
trust his/her confidential information to an encryption scheme that, for
(say) $100,000 could by cracked one time in a hundred?  (DES, for all the
complaints about a 56-bit key, would probably cost several million dollars
to build a keysearch machine for.)
 
   How many million dollars would the confidential phone messages of
the GM headquarters be worth to Nissan, Chrysler, or Audi?  How about
home phones of major execs and important engineers and designers?
"Gee, Mr Jones, I understand you've had some financial problems lately.
Maybe I can help..."
 
>>I'd trust something from the NSA long before I'd trust something from some
>>Swiss or anybody Japanese.
 
   Indeed, if NSA really designed the algorithm to be secure, it's very likely
as secure as IDEA or 2-key DES.  However, the system as a whole isn't resistant
to "practical cryptanalysis."  In _The Puzzle Palace_, Bamford describes how
several NSA employees were turned by foreign (presumably KGB) agents, despite
security measures that I doubt any Big 8 accounting firm could match.  And
NSA confidential data was *not* subject to being requested by thousands of
police organizations and courts across the land.

								Yeah!

	The algorithm is classified because a military contract (or similar
government equivalent to military) has been let for this "proprietary"
design that the Feds say that NSA developed.  Is there a patent?  Is that
patent publicly available?  My betting is that that too is classified.

	If the algorithm were made public, or reverse-engineered, it would
compromise not only the goal of Justice of being able to read every chip
users cypto-data but would reduce profits for the selected chip maker.

   Not necessarily.  I've been thinking about this, and if this chip/scheme
is to provide any real security, there must be some sort of key exchange,
either using a public-key encryption scheme, or using a key exchange scheme
like Diffie-Hellman.  If there's an out-of-band transmission of a shared
session key, then what protects that band from eavesdropping?  If the phone
company or some other online central authority generates a session key and
sends it to both users, then what's the point of going to the trouble of
having some complicated key-depositories?  Just ask the phone company for
a copy of the session key for each call.
 
   Now, it's probably not practical for each user to keep an online copy of
every public key used by anyone anywhere, right?  So, probably, there will
be some way of getting these keys verified.  This might be a digitally-
signed (by the chip manufacturer) copy of the public key in this unit,
stored by this unit.  It might also be an online directory with access to
everyone's public keys.  (This would introduce another weakness to the
security of the scheme, of course.)  Presumably, if you don't use your
designated key, you can't get a verified connection to other standard chips.
 
   It might be useful to have a modified chip, which would allow you to
use either the original public/private key pair, or some other key pair
and verification scheme.  Unfortunately, this would not allow you to call
most people and establish secure communications....

This isn't true.  Today's criminals regularly use all sorts of unsafe
methods, from cordless phones to cellular phones to plain old copper
wire analog phones that you can put alligator clips on to plan and
execute their crimes.

It is amazing how stupid they are, which is why the FBI was so keen on
the digital telphony law, and its successor the clipper chip.  They're
hoping here that most crooks will remain stupid, feel safe using clipper
chip phones and get caught.

   Perhaps one way of getting away from this cripple chip that the U.S.
government seems to be pushing would be to come up with a good alternative.
For example, how about a scheme using RSA, and some hybrid of DES-CFB and
another strong stream cipher (Maybe IDEA-CFB)?  This could be substantially
the same as the cripple chip, except that instead of key-registration, the
police could demand that you give up your secret key to them (with a court-
issued warrant).  Then, they could read the last few months of wiretapped
messages you've sent, and assuming you've committed no crimes, you could
generate a new key pair and go about your business.  I find that I'd be
willing to pay RSA for the right to use such a system, especially given the
alternative.  If you were unwilling to give up your secret key, then you'd
probably stay in jail (has anyone got a real legal precedent for this?).
   This would allow court-issued warrants to be used to gather information
on suspected criminals, but it couldn't be done in secrecy, and there
would be enormously less likelihood of corruption or theft of escrowed keys.
(Maybe someone from the law-enforcement or intelligent community will correct
me, but this doesn't *seem* like such a big loss in terms of law-enforcement
capabilities.)
 
   Any comments?

Oh? Hellman said ``each user will get to choose his or her own key.''
That's the key which I called K_P, the session key. According to
Hellman, if Alice and Bob are communicating with the Clipper Chip,
then Alice chooses ``her own key'' and Bob chooses ``his own key.''
This is incompatible with the suggestion that when Alice and Bob are
talking, they use a _common_ K_P, chosen by classical or public-key
approaches.

The protocol/key-management description published so far is either

I recall seeing a post some time ago saying that if the details of
an encryption scheme couldn't be revealed, then the encryption
scheme is worthless.  I believe the statement was in response to
somebody saying that they had some new snazzy scheme, but the
algorithm was a secret.

Does this algorithm depend on the fact that the scheme is secret or
is it for the stated reasons above?

  The idea that foisting the Cripple Chip standard on US manufacturers would
result in saying "Sayonara" to yet another high-tech market isn't technical,
isn't in the least difficult to understand, and plays on a concern lots of
people are worried about already....

It's really very feasible and shouldn't be too expensive - all that's needed
is a box with a phone jack on one side, a DSP in the middle to do codec
functions of speech->compressed bytestream, and an RS232 on the other side.

You'd plug your phone into it, plug the RS232 into your computer, and have
a good old fashioned normal modem on your other RS232 port.  The CPU in the
middle would do the encryption with a version of pgp modified to work on
a byte stream.

With v32bis or better modems to carry the bytestream, it should work. 
Quality would only be marginally lower than a normal telephone.

At the very highest price, you could use one of those voice-mail compatible
modems to do the digitisation - that puts an upper bound of about $500 on
the cost of such a box.  In practice, you really ought to be able to get
the price well below $100 - I could do it now in software on my cheap&nasty
home RISC box (Acorn Archimedes) with the digitising microphone I bought
for 25 pounds, if I knew how to write good speech compression software
(which I don't).

The reason it won't work of course is that hardly anyone will have one -
the only consumer equipment to have encryption will use the wiretap chip.
Economics, I'm afraid.

However... we can get about 2Kcps throughput on the internet even with
the bottleneck of a v32bis modem.  When we get ISDN for all (ha ha ha)
and the new NREN, it might then be trivial to run compressed speech
over a tcp/ip connection on the Internet.  Perhaps we should start
thinking now of a standard to keep voice on the internet compatible
for everyone, and side-step the clipper stuff and use internet for
all our phone calls in future :-)  [1/2 joking]

I can buy a DES keysearch machine off the shelf now for approx $500K, but
it is not sold by that name. Go buy a circuit emulation machine (eg. Quickturn)
containing a bunch of FPGAs, (say 500 to 1000 3090's), and program each
to be a DES search engine. Lets say 500 chips, running at 10Mhz = 5G tests/sec.
Time is 14e6 sec max = 23 weeks, 12 weeks average. Can't wait that long?
Buy a bigger machine.

There was an interesting column on the editorial page of the Dallas
Morning News on Saturday by Walter Williams, who I believe is a
professor at Georgetown (I wonder if he knows of Dorothy "you're not in

eroding our liberties", and in it he tells a story attributed to the
late Leonard Read who

        explained that if you wanted to take liberty away from
        Americans, you had to know how to cook a frog.  Mr. Read
        said you can't cook a frog by boiling a pot of water and
        then throwing the frog in.  His reflexes are so quick that
        as soon as his feet touch the water, he will leap away.
        You must put the frog in a pot of cold water and heat it
        up bit by bit.  By the time the frog realizes he's being
        cooked, it is too late.  It is the same with Americans.
        If anyone tried to take our freedoms all at once, we
        would naturally rebel and suppress the tyrant.  But as
        with successful frog cooking, our liberties can be taken
        a little bit at a time.

The last line of the article says, "It's not too late for us, but the
water is getting pretty warm."  I'd have toagree that it's warm and the
Clipper is keeping the temperature on an upward course.

I must respectfully disagree with this assertion, Brad.  The government is
notoriously sloppy with physical, communications, and information security.  They
can't keep their computers safe, and they're "trying".  Read "DEA is
Not Adequately Protecting National Security Information" [GAO/IMTEC 92-31] for an
excellent example of what I'm talking about.

Private sector organizations tend to be even more lax in their security measures.
I believe that the escrow organizations will be penetrated by foreign
intelligence services within months, if not weeks, of their selection.  Private
organizations that lack the resources of a full-fleged intelligence service will
take longer - perhaps on the order of one to two years.  Nonetheless, the
penetrations will take place, without question.

Even if you ignore the nonsense of the above statement for a moment,
and even if you are happy with such system and the current escrow
agencies NOW, what guarantees that you'll be happy with them TOMORROW,
when the government changes? Or when the current government throws
away the sheep skin? All the sheep who are reasoning like you will get
caught by surprise, but it will be too late, because then cryptography
that is not guaranteed to be breakable by the government will already
have been outlawed... After all, you've already got privacy that is
said to be breakable only by the law enforcement agencies, so if you
are law-abiding, you have no reasons to use a stronger one, right? So,
if you are using a stronger one, you have something to hide from the
law enforcement agencies, right? Something unlawful, right? Therefore,
strong crypto is a clear idndication that you are doing something
unlawful.

demonstrated in your messages, you would trust just anything... And
no, this is not an ad hominem attack; it's an attack against the
contents of your messages <grin>.

And how do you know that these experts are not corrupted? And how do
you know that they will not make a mistake? And how do you know that
the version of the algorithm they will be let to examine is the same
as the one that will be really used?

Regarding the mistake - even the few information "they" have let out
has revealed a serious security hole in the protocol - the 80-bit key
is split in two 40-bit ones, thus the whole system is easily
breakable, if you have only one of the keys.

The Swiss or the Japanese are motivated by simple greed; NSA is
motivated by their wish to control the people. That's why the drug
dealers have their accounts in Swiss banks, instead of in American
ones. For some reason, they do trust the Swiss banks more... Guess
they'll trust the Swiss encryption more too... I see IDEA becoming
suddenly popular... :-)

It's not surprising at all, but not because of the reason you give.
It's because it is obvious that the US government has put a lot of
money behind this program and it will support it. Thus, most
corporations will try to get their piece from the pie by supporting it
too. The same good old greed. Strong encryption is not widely
available now not because of some plot, but because the companies
don't see much money in it. It will be available even less, if the
companies can see any penalties associated with it...

> Just some perspective from another point of view.

Yeah, just as I predicted, you are here again, to support the new
system.

Agreed. No agency such as the NSA (or whoever) would approve the public 
release of a crypto-system, if they didn't already have the technical
means or the know-how to decrypt everything at their whim. Surely the whole
point of all this madness is to make Joe Public think that his/her
communications will be kept safe, while James Bond at the NSA can, if need
be, have full, decrypted access to someone's communications? That'll be
quite a heist, if they can pull it off. 


I thought that the US Government were going to release the algorithm to a
panel of "carefully chosen experts", who would then "study it deeply, and
report their findings"? Exactly who will these people be? Academics? Or
Government-sponsored researchers? Tiny-toons?

I can only hope that the same sort of thing doesn't start filtering over
into the ears of the UK Government, and if the European Parliament gets
wind of it, well, we can kiss goodbye to any form of Democracy in Europe 
at all.

As usual, David Sternlight is demonstrating his inability to read. The
proposal clearly states:

=> The initiative will involve the creation of new products to
=> accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure
=> telecommunications networks and wireless communications links.

It speaks about telecommunications in general. Read it again, David.
Maybe you'll understand it the next time... Nah, probably not.

That's exactly what the government wants all sheep-minded people to
think. Let's look at the current situation. It allows to almost
anybody to eavesdrop almost everybody, unless secure (and I mean
secure) encryption is used. What will happen when ("if"? Ha!
optimists...) the new proposal gets accepted? Almost nobody EXCEPT
SOME will be able to eavesdrop everybody else, but the ability of
these "some" to eavesdrop will be guaranteed! The proposal emphasizes
on the former ("almost nobody") - which is clearly an improvement -
and "forgets" to mention the drawbacks of the latter ("guaranteed").
Yes, my statement assumes that the next step will be to make the
strong crypto unlawful. You think that it will not happen? Good luck.

It's not just "continued ability". It's -guaranteed- ability.

Yeah, that's exactly what your government wants you to think. Let's
take small steps, one at a time. Concentrate on the current one, don't
think about the future. Trust us.

It's not asked because the proposal clearly says that this is the
intention. They, unlike you, read what they write.

Yes, it will. It will stop the jerk who is eavesdropping now. It will
allow only to the government to eavesdrop. (If the scheme is secure,
of course, which is yet to be proven.) But how do you know that the
jerk you are fearing now will not get a government job tomorrow? The
new proposal -guarantees- him the ability to eavesdrop then. Hell,
that will even motivate him to get that job - if he indeed is that
mentally pervert...

Great. The Greatest Cryptographer of All Times David Sternlight (tm)
has succeeded to evaluate the new system in the absense of any
details whatsoever and has concluded that it is "highly secure". I
guess, that comes from the background of working some 50 years for the
two major crypto evaluating companies, right? Gee, now the government
can save all that money and trouble to ask a secret council of crypto
experts to secretly analyse the new secret method - for David
Sternlight has already done all the job for them...

The main question is to guarantee to availability of -really- secure
cryptography to the masses. Gee, if the proposal was saying "we
guarantee that every American will still have the full right to use
any kind of encryption s/he would like and regard this proposal as
just a default, voluntary implementation", there would have been much
less opposition... For some reason, they didn't even try to promise
you that. I wonder why... Was Orwell off only by 10 years?

No, in return you get crypto that is guaranteed to be crippled.

While the above is just rumors, and while even if it is true, it is
not done -easily-, the new scheme can is guaranteed to be easily
breakable by anybody who has the two keys. It might be also breakable
by somebody who does not have them but knows the right trick. Or who
has only one of them. NSA also told you that DES is secure, why don't
you simply trust them, huh?

It is -guaranteed- to be -easily- breakable - just get the keys. It

wild speculation.

Legitimate? And who decides what communications are legitimate? Oh, I

It's kinda if I have the keys from your car and I am asked to decide
who has the right to use it "legitimately"...

Here are some corrections and additions to Hellman's note, courtesy of
Dorothy Denning.  Again, this is reposted with permission.

Two requests -- first, note the roles of S1 and S2.  It appears to me
and others that anyone who knows those values can construct the unit
key.  And the nature of the generation process for K1 and K2 is such
that neither can be produced alone.  Thus, the scheme cannot be
implemented such that one repository generates the first half-key, and
another generates the second.  *That* is ominous.

Second -- these postings are not revealed scripture, nor are they
carefully-crafted spook postings.  Don't attempt to draw out hidden
meanings (as opposed to, say, the official announcements of Clipper).
Leave Denning out of this; given Hellman's record of opposition to DES,
which goes back before some folks on this newsgroup knew how to read, I
don't think you can impugn his integrity.

Oh yeah -- the folks who invented Clipper aren't stupid.  If you think
something doesn't make sense, it's almost certainly because you don't
understand their goals.

To: (a long list of folks)

I was also briefed by the NSA and FBI, so let me add a few comments to
Marty's message:

        The Clipper Chip will have a secret crypto algorithm embedded in 

The algorithm operates on 64-bit blocks (like DES) and the chip supports
all 4 DES modes of operation.  The algorithm uses 32 rounds of scrambling
compared with 16 in DES.

	In addition to the system key, each user will get to choose his 
	or her own key and change it as often as desired. Call this key 
	plain old K. When a message is to be sent it will first be 

K is the session key shared by the sender and receiver.  Any method
(e.g., public key) can be used to establish the session key.  In the
AT&T telephone security devices, which will have the new chip, the key
is negotiated using a public-key protocol.
 
	encrypted under K, then K will be encrypted under the unit key UK, 
	and the serial number of the unit added to produce a three part 
	message which will then be encrypted under the system key SK 
	producing

	     E{ E[M; K], E[K; UK], serial number;  SK}

My understanding is that E[M; K] is not encrypted under SK (called the
"family key") and that the decrypt key corresponding to SK is held by
law enforcement.  Does anyone have first hand knowledge on this?  I
will also check it out, but this is 7am Sunday so I did not want to wait.

        The unit key 
	will be generated as the XOR of two 80-bit random numbers K1 
	and K2 (UK=K1+K2) which will be kept by the two escrow 

The unit key, also called the "chip key," is generated from the
serial number N as follows.  Let N1, N2, and N3 be 64 bit blocks
derived from N, and let S1 and S2 be two 80-bit seeds used as keys.
Compute the 64-bit block 

        R1 = E[D[E[N1; S1]; S2]; S1] 

(Note that this is like using the DES in triple encryption mode with
two keys.)  Similarly compute blocks R2 and R3 starting with N2 and N3.
(I'm unlear about whether the keys S1 and S2 change.  The fact that
they're called seeds suggests they might.)  Then R1, R2, and R3 are
concatenated together giving 192 bits.  The first 80 bits  form K1 and
the next 80 bits form K2.  The remaining bits are discarded.

	decided by the Attorney General, but it was stressed to me that 
	they will NOT be NSA or law enforcement agencies, that they 
	must be parties acceptable to the users of the system as unbiased. 

Marty is right on this and the FBI has asked me for suggestions.
Please pass them to me along with your reasons.  In addition to Marty's
criteria, I would add that the agencies must have an established record
of being able to safeguard highly sensitive information.  Some suggestions
I've received so far include SRI, Rand, Mitre, the national labs (Sandia,
LANL, Los Alamos), Treasury, GAO.

	they may do this constantly on all links, with or without a 
	court order, since it is almost impossible to tell which links 
	over which a message will flow.] 

My understanding is that there will be only one decode box and that it
will be operated by the FBI.  The service provider will isolate the
communications stream and pass it to the FBI where it will pass through
the decode box, which will have been keyed with K.

        comply and changed the system, but the lesson is clear: 
        No single person or authority should have the power to
        authorize wiretaps

No single person does, at least for FBI taps.  After completing a mound
of paperwork, an agent must get the approval of several people on a chain
that includes FBI legal counsel before the request is even taken to the
Attorney General for final approval.

Instead of reading between the lines, try to think a little bit. OK,
if that's way too difficult to you, here are some hints.

Indeed, the new proposal imposes some additional burocratic burden on
the local police, if they badly want to tape the magic cookie recipie
that your mom is telling you on the phone. So, guess what they will
do? Propose that the new technology is removed? Or implement some
"facilitations"? Of course, you won't want to wait until they get the
approval from two different agencies to decrypt the conversation
between two child molesters, because meanwhile those two child
molesters might be conspiring about molesting your child, right? So,
there should be some way for them to get access to those keys
-quickly-, right? Like, they could have a copy of the database, and
worry about a warrant later...

I've been asked to supply more specific directions
for automated fetching of the source and documentation
for "agrep," the powerful similarity pattern matching tool.

It is at

cs.arizona.edu
192.12.69.5

in directory

/agrep/README
/agrep/agrep-2.04.tar.Z
/agrep/agrep.ps.1.Z
/agrep/agrep.ps.2.Z

(The .ps suffixed files are the optional postscript docs; 
a reasonably good research report with benchmarks is
included.)

Note for Macintosh MPW users: after a few hours of drudgery,
I ported the tool to MPW 3.2.3 running under System 7.1.
If you would like me to e-mail a binhexed copy of the tool
suitable for dropping in to your MPW/tools folder, please write...

Other than the more purely cryptographic uses for the tool
I've been having lots of fun picking up the "lost"
references to things I'm interested in. For example,
starting a search like:

agrep -1 -i 'Burning Chrome' cyberpunkspool 

immediately finds references like 'burning crome' that I
have always missed before.  See how many times John
Gilmore's name is mentioned in the CUD archives
(and how often misspelled).  How about _your_ name?

As usual, I will e-mail the uuencoded tar.Z upon request
if you cannot do anonymous FTP.

  Misinterpretation, though it should be a crime in itself, is what
United States lawyers use to make their bread and butter.

  In Manchester, CT a few years ago, a small company wanted to run a
game system galled "LaserGames," similar in many aspects to Photon
(tm). Three lawyers and about a hundred citizens found an ancient law
in Manchester's books which clearly from context was designed to
prohibit travelling carnivals by enumerating the features of a carnival
which they felt at the time made the prohibition obvious. Among these
things was "shooting galleries," which is what the lawyers for the
opposition to LaserGames wanted to harp upon. The judge took the two
words from this law, completely out of context, and ruled that
LaserGames could not operate in Manchester.

  Keep in mind that most travelling carnivals use projectile weapons in
their shooting galleries, and not light beams. Clearly from context,
LaserGames got shafted, but if the two words are applied, their denial
of operating permission was justified.

  If I had the text of the law I'd post it, but I'm afraid I don't
remember it all well enough to even try. That little bit with the two
words stuck well, though.

I recently published a new privacy-protecting off-line electronic cash
system as a technical report at CWI. Being a PhD-student at David
Chaum's cryptography-group, our group has a long history in research
in the field of privacy-protecting cash systems.

The report is called CS-R9323.ps.Z, contains 77 pages, and can be
retrieved from

ftp.cwi.nl   (192.16.184.180)

from the directory pub/CWIreports/AA.
The postscript-file is suitable for 300dpi laserprinters.

====================================================================
ABSTRACT (from coverpage): We present a new off-line electronic cash
system based on a problem, called the representation problem, of which
little use has been made in literature thus far. Our system is the
first to be based entirely on discrete logarithms.  Using the
representation problem as a basic concept, some techniques are
introduced that enable us to construct protocols for withdrawal and
payment that do not use the cut and choose methodology of earlier
systems. As a consequence, our cash system is much more efficient in
both computation and communication complexity than any such system
proposed previously.
  
Another important aspect of our system concerns its provability.
Contrary to previously proposed systems, its correctness can be
mathematically proven to a very great extent. Specifically, if we
make one plausible assumption concerning a single hash-function, the
ability to break the system seems to imply that one can break the
Diffie-Hellman problem. 
  
Our system offers a number of extensions that are hard to achieve in
previously known systems. In our opinion the most interesting of these
is that the entire cash system (including all the extensions) can be
incorporated in a setting based on wallets with observers, which has
the important advantage that double-spending can be prevented in the
first place, rather than detecting the identity of a double-spender
after the fact. In particular, it can be incorporated even under the
most stringent requirements conceivable about the privacy of the user,
which seems to be impossible to do with previously proposed systems.
Another benefit of our system is that framing attempts by a bank have
negligible probability of success (independent of computing power) by
a simple mechanism from within the system, which is something that
previous solutions lack entirely. Furthermore, the basic cash system
can be extended to checks, multi-show cash and divisibility, while
retaining its computational efficiency.
====================================================================

Cryptographers are challenged to try to break this system!  

I made a particular effort to keep the report as self-contained as
possible.  Nevertheless, if you have any questions, please e-mail to
me and I will try to reply as good as I can. Any comments are also
welcome!

I have also been in contact with Mitch about this. I believe
him when he says he didn't ask to be on the "clipper" list.

He also forwarded the traffic he had recieved through that list to
me which will be placed at some ftp site.

However, the first alias on the "clipper list" was csspab which was

these people had their accounts within the dockmaster domain.

These are the people we might wish to FOIA...

(a) To use for sensitive but not strategically important traffic,
(b) if the system was cheap.

For example, I don't own a cordless phone.  With Clipper, I would.  If the 
local men in blue really want to listen to me talk to my friends or order 
pizza, I'm no worse off than I am now, and I don't have to worry about
local kids or nosy neighbors.

That is to say, Clipper "raises the bar" on insecure channels.  It doesn't 
make them secure, by any means, but a wall, even if the FBI can get a master 
key by court order, is still better than a "keep off the grass" sign.

So, where can I buy a DES-encrypted cellular phone?  How much does it cost?

It's OK, it's OK... Just a month ago I expressed my belief that the
right to have a means to shoot your neighbor is not that much
necessary to ensure a people's right to be free and got flamed by lots
of American gun supporters. So I thought that...

Never mind. The new Cripple Chip is a purely American problem, so deal

Bulgarian) - because I thought that it might be useful to you. Oh
well.

Not necessarily --- they could release the details of the algorithm
without releasing the "system key" (called SK by Hellman).  That would
make most people happy, and with some sort of verification procedure
before key exchange, the "official" chips would only work with other
"official" chips.  In other words, secrecy of SK makes "physically
identical clone versions" impossible;  secrecy of the algorithm shouldn't
be necessary.

Of course, revealing the algorithm opens them up to attacks on SK ---
since all units share this key, compromising it may be a big deal.
Personally, I wouldn't feel too comfortable knowing that one "secret"
80-bit number held in many places was all that guaranteed my security.
Of course, compromise of SK doesn't necessarily mean that the system
is compromised, but it's impossible to tell whether or not that's true
with a secret algorithm.

Incidentally, what's to keep a "secret algorithm" from using the secret
SK as the main key, with UK being only marginally important.  Then
a court order for UK may not even be necessary to do a wiretap.

I understand, believe it or not, and there are any number of kinds of 
conversation and communication I engage in that I wouldn't even consider 
using this scheme for.  On the other hand, I don't see "Clipper" as providing 
a secure channel--it just prevents casual eavesdropping.  This is part of why 
I am not worried about it per se.  Trying to look at Clipper as a serious 
security tool is simply ludicrous.  It's a voice scrambler, nothing more.

There is still plenty of market for real crypto.

They cost an arm and a leg, though. "Clipper" is obviously aimed at the mass 
market.  It certainly won't put Cylink out of business.

This is old news.  I can do this now.

There ARE restrictions.  Example: We're a networking software vendor with a 
large overseas share of our market.  We cannot currently ship PEM, or even 
simple DES, in our products without case-by-case approval from the Department 
of State.  ITAR presents a material trade barrier to US firms trying to 
compete in international information systems markets.

Sure, you can use whatever freebie software you want to talk over BBS's in 
the USA.  I, on the other hand, want strong crypto (PKCS, for example) to be 
the *default* for electronic mail, worldwide.  I want priests to be able to 
hear confession over email.  I want lawyers to be able to talk to clients in 
confidence over email, or doctors talk with patients.  I want to be able to 
order products from my favorite Japanese mail-order catalog over the net.  I 
want to be able to sign contracts, transact business, and so on 
electronically.

This is so far infeasible as a result of the current restrictions on 
crytographic systems, especially beyond the borders of the USA.

Clipper is irrelevant, and if it distracts the authorities into feeling safe, 
all the better.  Its only danger is if it emboldens them into trying to put 
more restrictions into place, on the theory that it is "good enough for 
anyone who has nothing to hide."  That argument is, of course, utter BS, just 
as much as "no one needs an assault rifle".

False, as federal courts have affirmed on many occasions.  This is getting

I am sure that Mike is correct on this point.  I am also pretty sure that
administering "truth serum" would be ruled a violation of your right
not to incriminate yourself.  But, what is the salient difference?
Both drawing blood and injecting "truth serum" incapacitate you for
a while, but do no permanent damage.  Is it simply that we have come to
view one as acceptable, while the other is viewed as a fundamental
violation of one's rights?  If this is the case, how do we expand the
protections of the 5th amendment to incorporate new technologies without
the results being a hodgepodge of different judges personal opinions?

( Below is my response to Dr. Denning's letter to Steven Bellovin. Comments
  are invited. - Paul )

In alt.privacy.clipper, Steve Bellovin posted your message to
him, which included a brief passage concerning selection of agencies
as escrow agencies.

I am glad to see that the proposal as written states that the escrow
agencies won't be law enforcement agencies. I would argue, however,
that *one* of the escrow agencies shouldn't be federal at all.

As a private citizen, I would feel much more "secure in my person and
papers" knowing that an organization committed to individual civil
liberties- the ACLU and the NRA come to mind- was safeguarding half of
my key. Both the ACLU and the NRA are resistent to government pressure
by the simple expedient fact that they are not supported, funded, or
overtly controlled by the government.

Of those federal and federally funded candidate agencies that you
mentioned, I have the following comments:

	- SRI, Rand, Mitre, and national labs: I agree that they have
        great experience safeguarding sensitive information. I am not
        convinced that they would adequately safeguard _this_
	information, since in any case requiring disclosure, there's
      	likely to be sigificant pressure for disclosure- possibly
 	*wrongful* disclosure.

	- GAO: perhaps. I would like to see more concrete evidence of
 	their fidelity and ability.

	- *TREASURY*? Surely you're joking. Perhaps you'd ask BATF
	to safeguard keys. Maybe the Federal Reserve would be a 
	better choice.

Ever since last fall's "trial balloon" was posted in sci.crypt, your
name has been synonymous with those who place a great deal of trust in
the ability of government agencies and agents to act within the law.

I agree with you in part: those agencies and agents *almost always*
act properly. However, there have been enough cases where _sworn
agents of the Federal Government_ have acted wrongly to make me feel
that having two federal agencies as key repositories is unacceptable.

Subject: Re:  Clipper Chip

I just had another conversation with NSA to clarify some of the features
of Clipper.  Please feel free to distribute this and my other messages
on Clipper.

The name of the encryption algorithm is "Skipjack."

Martin Hellman had written

                and the serial number of the unit added to produce a three part
                message which will then be encrypted under the system key SK
                producing

                     E{ E[M; K], E[K; UK], serial number;  SK}

To which I responded:

        My understanding is that E[M; K] is not encrypted under SK (called the
        "family key") and that the decrypt key corresponding to SK is held by
        law enforcement.  Does anyone have first hand knowledge on this?

I was correct in that E[M; K] is not encrypted under SK.  However, Skipjack
being a single-key system, there is, of course, not a separate decrypt key
for the family key SK.

        The unit key, also called the "chip key," is generated from the
        serial number N as follows.  Let N1, N2, and N3 be 64 bit blocks
        derived from N, and let S1 and S2 be two 80-bit seeds used as keys.
        Compute the 64-bit block

                R1 = E[D[E[N1; S1]; S2]; S1]

        (Note that this is like using the DES in triple encryption mode with
        two keys.)  Similarly compute blocks R2 and R3 starting with N2 and N3.
        (I'm unlear about whether the keys S1 and S2 change.  The fact that
        they're called seeds suggests they might.)  Then R1, R2, and R3 are
        concatenated together giving 192 bits.  The first 80 bits  form K1 and
        the next 80 bits form K2.  The remaining bits are discarded.

The seeds S1 and S2 do not change.   The whole process is performed on
a laptop computer, and S1 and S2 are supplied by two independent people
so that no one person knows both.  The same S1 and S2 are used during
an entire "programming session" to generate keys for a stream of serial
numbers.  Everything is discarded at the end (the computer could be
thrown out if desired).

The serial number is 30 bits and the values N1, N2, and N3 are formed
by padding the serial number with fixed 34-bit blocks (separate padding
for each value).

The resulting keys K1 and K2 are output onto separate floppy disks, paired
up with their serial number.  Each pair is stored in a separate file.  The
floppy disks are taken away by two separate people on behalf of the two
escrow agencies.

I am sure more technical detail will be known when time goes by.
Please remark, that in posting this, I do not automatically agree

I just think this is an valuable addition to the less than technical
discussion that is rising here. And, no, I don't mind if you call
S1 and S2 'backdoor', as I could imagine the key-generation process
working without these seeds and the dependency of K1,K2 from the
Serial-Number.

You can find the salient difference in any number of 5th amendment
related Supreme Court opinions. The Court limits 5th amendment
protections to what they call "testimonial" evidence, as opposed to
physical evidence.

The whole question would hinge on whether a crypto key would be
considered "testimonial" evidence. I suppose arguments could be made
either way, though obviously I would hope it would be considered
testimonial.

Let me see if I have this straight --- if a person knows S1 and S2,
and the serial number of the unit, it's easy to reconstruct UK.
Of course, if they know SK, the "family key", they can easily get the
serial number of any unit that has made a transmission.  So with S1 and
S2 being used for a while "batch" of the unit keys, the number of
used S1/S2 pairs will probably be fairly low.  Of course, you have to
believe that the NSA/FBI/name-your-favorite-government agency will
know SK so all it needs is the S1/S2 pairs, and presto, nasty details 
like court orders for wire taps are no longer necessary.

Now, I'm not one of the people who distrusts the government at every
turn, but taking someone's word for it that the S1/S2 pairs are not kept
around is pushing what I'm willing to believe just a little bit too far.

If we do not trust the NSA to be a registrar of Clipper Chip key halves,
I would not trust Mitre either.  Mitre does lots of work for NSA, at least
in the Trusted Product Evaluation Program (evaluation of commercial off the
shelf software for its efficacy in safeguarding classified information), and
I assume in other, less open, programs.

There are at least two other FFRDCs (Federally Funded Research and Development
Corporations) that work for NSA: Aerospace Corporation and the Institute for
Defense Analysis.  Now, if NSA were to be untrustworthy (a position that I
am neutral about, for purposes of this posting), it would be in a position to
exert economic pressure upon Mitre to release key halves on demand.  It could
just say, "If you don't cooperate with us, we'll place all our evaluation
contracts with Aerospace and IDA."

I am not saying that people at NSA, Mitre, Aerospace, or IDA are dishonest
folk.  But since they are people, and people occasionally go bad, the
system works better if organizations that you are depending upon to be
independent really are.

And, of course, I speak for myself, not my employer.

Hmm, followup on my own posting... Well, who cares.

First let me try to work out the facts that we get to know about the
Clipper-Chip, from what Hellman and Denning were able to tell us:

The chip itself is not confined to (digital) telephony, but performs
general encryption in a symmetric manner.  The chip supports CFB OFB
ECB (and whatever the fourth mode of operation for DES is), the algorithm
consists of 32 rounds of *whatever*, and takes 80-Bit keys. Input data
seems to be 64 Bit? Yes.
So if two people want secure communication (whatever that means when 
Clipper is involved) they have first to agree on ONE secret key. 
(Or is it one key per direction ?)
They can exchange this key via DH-schemes or however.
Somehow the two feed their so won secret key into the Clipper-chip
which is now ready to work.
The clipper chip carries an unique Serial-Number (30 Bit's), and 160 Key-Bits.
These 160 key-bits seem to have been gained by encrypting the serial-number
with 160 seed-bits. (The seed-bits seem not to be stored in the chip)
At beginning of communication (and perhaps at certain invtervals whithin??)
before sending the fist real 64-bit output of the first encryption the Clipper
chip put's out packets (I guess 3) which represent the serial number,
and the session key. This might look like
X{ E[K; chipkeyK1+K2], serial number}
where X is a transformation of these 3? Packets involving a family-key.
This family(sp?)-key is equal for ALL chips. (X might be a simple XOR ???)
After that, the (digital?) phone-call can be done as usual, every packet
being encrypted and decrypted by Clipper.

Denning describes how K1 and K2 shall be generated, using a seed of 160
Bit's.

Now, leaving alone politics, which does not concern me as much as you, not
being an American Citicien(tm) [ :-) ] , there are some weak points in this
scheme, which might be exploited by several parties.

As far as I know about the generation of K1,K2 ; S1 and S2 look like the 
obvious backdoor. They could be used to generate the chip-keys by knowing
the serial-number (and also the family-key) of the chip. I really can't
imagine why these seeds would be needed otherwise, as true random-sources
for the generation of the K1,K2 can be bought for not to much money.

Then, the escrows. Each of them will get 80 bit of a 160-Bit key. Security
could (as little as existant) be maximized by giving them 160-bits
each, which have to be xored together to give the K1,K2. Now let's simply
assume the escrows are trustworthy, and can't be fooled by criminals or
law enforchemnt agencies. (And there will be no quarrel between escrows
and l.e.a which would hinder the l.e.a in doing their duties, and so on
and so on) Once the keys are surrendered, the corresponding
chip is compromised forever. Not very clever, IMHO [ :-)) ].
How about sending in the encrypted session-keys for each phone-call that
the police (or whoever) want's to listen to? Escrows could then simply decode
this session-key and send it back to police. (And would naturally not do this
after the warrant has expired...) This would be a better technical solution,
but I guess politics will not work that way.

Apparently (as Miss Dennings stated) the only one performing actually decodes
of intercepted messages shall be the FBI. Great. So local guys can not inter-
cept (understand) your traffic anymore. Does this mean that the FBI monopolizes
the right to do legal wiretaps ? (How is law over there, I have no idea who
is allowed to tap, and who not) This certainly means that watched communi-
cations will be routed automatically from the service-providing company
to the FBI, if the communicaiton is a watched one. And this means as far
as I understand it that the family-key has to be known by each switching-
company, and those providing cellular-phone servies etcetc. So the family-key
will not be very secret, and thus serial-numbers of calls will be readable
by anybody who cares. I _like_ traffic-analysis!

What do you guess, what happens, if you use the chip in ECB mode, and the
first few packets of the chip are somehow lost or garbled? So the session
key would not be actually broadcasted over the line? Hmmm. Shouldn't be so
difficult to do *that* :^)

And now a last point, for the other side. After all I have read and heard about
Clipper (not the programming language for dBase, is it ? [:-)]) it seems
to have many advantages, which shold not be overseen!


Now an afterthought to your rights. Please note that I have no idea what I am
talking about!!!

I wholeheartedly agree.  Knowing that WE have let our law enforcement agencies
seize our property against the Fifth Amendment of OUR Constitution tells me that
we are absolving ourselves of our responsibility for SELF-GOVERNANCE.  WE have
to take our government back from the self-serving politicians who create laws
and rules only to better their positions within the government.  WE have allowed
them to take too much power from the people of this nation.  That situation has
to be changed.

Allowing the law enforcement agencies to use the seized property to pay-off drug
informants who lie and continue to deal in drugs is tantamount to making a pact
with the Devil himself.  It's a vicious cycle.  The law enforcement agencies are
motivated to seize property to fund their own activities.  And having no easy
way for the citizen to regain the property intact once taken gives even more
incentive for the agencies to take property.

It's also interesting to note that two months ago Rush Limbaugh said that
Clinton would have the "plumbers" out in force shortly.  Clinton and his
henchmen firmly believe in strong ubiquitous government control.  Anytime a
leader believes in that, the leader will use every means possible to retain that
control and take more.

WE have to take OUR government back.  Otherwise we will end up living in the
equivalent of a high-tech third world dictatorship.  We have to take
responsibility for ourselves, our personal welfare, and our actions.

Wonder what happened to IBM, this should be right up their street.

Telephone encryption and scrambleing are years behind digital ones like RSA,
IDEA, or even DES. The above, while literaly true, is a clasic straw-man claim
in the context of non-real-time circuits such as E-mail and the like.

Note the use of the word "business" in the above. The whole tenor of this
release seems to be establishing a ground rule that only "business" use
is legitimate for debate. If you want the nothings you drop in your wife's
ear to remain secret and private, that is not even on the agenda for debate.
Note that there is NO role for you to contain private info in this. The only
reference is to information already in the hands of others. The 'unauthorized
release' bit is also drawing a long bow. Most of these cases are by people who
have legitimate access abusing it, and revealing, or often selling the info.
These people are, of course, in this proposal, the people who will have the
keys.

The criminals also use lawers, courts, the CIA, white-house officials and pens
to go about their business. When will they be outlawed as well? Yeah, several
of them would be a better idea than CLipper!

Them again, the protections of law and the courts have been seriously erroded
over the last decade ofr so.

Note the repeated mixing of telephone scrabeling and encryption. A demo

The case record seems to indicate that what is needed is a brutal tightening
of the current abuses. I have not heard, yet, of a case that was impeaded by
the use of secure encryption by the men in black. The other side, abuse by law
enforcers is well documented, even by govt agencies. And the phone vs other coms
is blurred yet again.

Lets run that line twice. Not **VERY** carefully what it says. The stated
purpose of the key eschrow is to make the use of Clipper compulsory. Note the
word "ensure". As to 'protect', or 'law-abiding', I will leave to you.
So to the person who asked if it included the outlawing of other encryptions,
the answer in this press release is, YES.

Where do you find many experts. Any ex KGB people looking for a contract? :-)
And as a later posting asks, what of the STU-IIIs they already have. It will
be very interesting to see if the military and US embasies start to use it.
After all, it is secure, isn't it. The govt will answer that point by its own
actions.

Encryption and codes have been around for millenia. They are generaly in
equilibrium with the technology of the time. The systematic study of cyphers
has resulted in a swing in favor of the encrypter, AT THE MOMENT. I have no
doubt that the factoring problem will fall in time. Probably fofr practical
purposes by the middle of the next century.

This link between the security of the key-eschrow, and the actual algorithm is 
a real winner. Given that I have 2 secret 40 bit numbers, could someone please

They don't seem to be saying anything that makes much sense. And this proposal
DOES prohibit it except in a very limited way. And, this is the one explicit
reference to personal rights. It is a denial. And yes, I don't think that the

The 'false tension' is false. The balance is between two repugnant points. The
RIGHT to privacy is hand-waved to non-existance by putting it behind the "false
assessment". It is assumed that the removal of the right to take what ever steps
YOU deem suitable to protect YOUR privacy is non negotiable, hence is defined
in the govenment language to be non-existant. If you don't agree, you must be a
criminal, as only criminals don't agree with out laws. Also note the non-
question. "If what is here was not possible..."

The system, or 'family', key would appear to be cryptographically
useless, since *every* chip must know it and be able to remove its
effects from the bitstream.  I daresay that it will be widely known
almost immediately after this system is deployed, and since it's been
pointed out that there is not a separate decrypt key -- the same key
is used for both encryption and decryption -- there goes any benefit
to the use of a system-wide key in SkipJack.

   The Second and Fourth Amendments do come to mind.  

The Second Amendment is especially apt, given the ITAR definitions of
crypto equipment as munitions, and the gun-control people's increasing
ability to define things as "assault weapons" and make them illegal.
Triple-DES is obviously used for "assault phones", while
Cripple will be legal, and Triple-Cripple may fall into the gray area
of "illegally upgrading to an assault phone"...

Read the Constitution yourself.  The Second Amendment says the right to bear

You don't care that people are being lied to, fooled into believing

don't give a shit about anybody's privacy except your own?  (And
not even your own; are you so smart that you know when you're talking to

"Simply?" "Everyone" should have this attitude?   The only people
who can have this attitude are the most hard-core
computer hackers, who never make phone calls away from their
computer, who apparently never call anybody except another computer 
hacker, or perhaps another spook (U.S. classified agents refuse to use
their own system, only oblivious civilian dupes get that dubious privilege).
Only spooks and hard-core hackers need privacy, huh?

We *do* need an alternative to NSA-bugged telephones, but
we're talking inexpensive *telephones* here, including hand-sized
cellulars, that need strong crypto, real privacy.  Make-shift
computer hacker rigs that require living by your computer to
talk privately over the phone are just a dumb stunt that doesn't 
do anything for anybody's privacy in the real world.  

What we need is a true *privacy chip*.  For example, a real-time 
voice-encryption RSA, put it into a silicon compiler and spit out ASIC.  
Put this chip on the market as a de facto standard for international 
business, diplomats, and private communications.  If the U.S. bans 
it, we make it somewhere else and import it.  The Japanese, German,
Dutch, Taiwanese, Korean, etc. electronics companies don't want the 
NSA spying on them.  U.S. workers lose more jobs to government fascist
stupidity.

The final stages of denial... I can hardly imagine what the result
would have been if the Clinton administration had actually supported
this plan, instead of merely acquiescing with repugnance as they've so
obviously doing.  I don't believe the chip originated with the Clinton
administration either, but the Clinton administration has embraced it
and brought it to fruition.

Both of the major parties have what they consider excellent reasons
for limiting your freedoms and violating your privacy, and even seem
to feel that they're doing you a favor.  If this is really surprising
to anyone it means they've been willfully ignoring quite a bit of
previous evidence.  There's only one political party (not calling
anarchists a party) that considers your freedom and privacy goals
worthy in and of themselves.  If you're voting for the big two, you're
supporting a reduction of those rights (given their goals and their
histories), regardless of whether you personally support that
reduction.  To paint Clinton and Gore as unwitting tools is really
stretching things.

    No kidding.  The most recent post I saw in alt.privacy.clipper (and I
hope anyone interested in this topic ends up there) states that Clipper
has been in development for over four years.

    I am, however, more than a little PO'd that Clinton put his name on
this monstrosity, or even allowed it to get out the door, for that matter.
He's already heard from me, and I hope you'll all take the time to voice
your extreme displeasure as well.

I have a question that is a slight variation on the previously mentioned
examples that perhaps people could give me some pointers on (it has been a
couple of years since my Con Law class in college so I hope I am not
missing something obvious here...)

Basic Scenario:

	I set up a bbs that uses public-key encryption and encryption of
	files on disk.  The general setup is designed so that when users 
	connect they send a private key encrypted using the system public
	key and the user's public-private keypair is used to wrap the
	one-time session keys used for encrypting the files on disk.  The
	result of this is that even if I reveal the system private key it
	is impossible for anyone to gain access to the files stored on the
	machine.  What is possible is for someone to use the revealed
	system private key to entice users into revealing thier personal
	private keys during the authentication sequence.

Questions:

	Does the fact that the system private key does not provide any
	information useful for a search give me any protection as far as
	being coerced to reveal the key?  (I doubt it myself..)

	It seems providing the system private key does not mean that I am
	assisting in "entrapment" (the users would send thier key anyway
	and are not being enticed into doing something they would not
	otherwise do) but is there any other hook that can be used?

	Would the user private-key enticement require wiretap approval?

Any answers or general musings on the subject would be appreciated...

At first I was going to complain that your analogy was completely
irrelevant.  But then I remembered something.

Remember that move to get the U.S. to the metric system all those
years ago?  As far as I know we were supposed to be there by now.

The government sold it as better for the people, easier to be in
tune with the rest of the world.  They had decided it was for
our own good.

Then, when the plan was released, it soon became apparant that the
government were a bunch 'o' thickies.

Think about it, change all the railroad track widths, signs,
screws, abolish the old regime.

At the cost of millions of dollars.

Your point is well taken.  You think there is nothing to worry
about, you could care less who designs your cryptography, any
more than who designs your screws or the system of measurement
you use.

Sit back, that's right, just relax, we'll take care of all your
needs Mr. Molitor.

     In previous postings by Hellman, Bellovin, etal it was
reported the Big Brother (Clipper) chip will encrypt plaintext in
64 bit blocks as is done with DES.  The users key K which can be
derived from RSA, Diffy-Hellman, etc. is used to encrypt
plaintext M and is then used to form a "three part message".
     This three part message consists of E[M; K], K encrypted
with some other key, and the chip serial number.  This three part
message is then encrypted by still another key.
     My question is: What is a message?
     For example, say we are dealing with an encrypted digitized
voice application.  The speech waveform is sampled and digitized
and then some number of samples are grouped into a 64 bit block.
This block is then encrypted and transmitted over a non-secure
communications link.
     Where is the three part message?  Is something appended to
each 64 bit block?  Is a header sent at the beginning of the
session?
     If the header is sent at the beginning of the session, how
do they insure the equipment manufacturer using the chip does
just that?  Can just anyone manufacture products using the chip?
Is a facility clearance required to manufacture?
     Any ideas?

I am sure you didn't miss the implication that we could have another
Richard Nixon type president in the future (perhaps not too distant
future, acutally).  With that in mind, then I take it you also would
not object to the Gov coming up with a decision (not proposal - just
like Clinton Cripple is a decision, not a proposal) sprung on us to
start placing video cameras with sound in every room of your house,
which could be activated without your knowlege.  They would be well
concealed so you wouldn't know the location, to prevent you from covering
the lens opening.  After all, nothing you're doing would be of the
slightest interest to a government official, right?  So, you surely
should not object to such a proposal...

Not the best anology, but the principle is pretty close - the ability
to eavesdrop on your activity with little or no effort, without your
knowlege, protected by entirely by "government safeguards".  You can
still draw your curtains, so you can still have your privacy from everyone
else (except Big Brother)!!  After all we need this for protection from
drug dealers and terrorists and other criminals (like 'enemies of the
STATE')... and you don't really have a right to "unbreakable" privacy
anyway, sort of as the press release of the Clinton Cripple DECISION
puts it...

I find it curious they use the word "unbreakable" when the term really
should be "difficult to break without proper authorization" (which the
Government most certainly has at their disposal, right?  They wouldn't
want to be able to break it ILLEGALLY, would they?)...  Nawww, not
"for the People" Clinton....

Can you, while my mind is on it, give us one good reason that the
algorithm should be a secret algorithm, unless this encryption scheme
either is a joke, or contains features like a 'master key' or other back
door for UNAUTHORIZED eavesdropping? If it was really even moderately
secure, and the government really meant to require the proper court
order and the keys that are in the Escrow accounts to be able to decipher
the traffic, what is the need to keep the algorithm secret?  Seems I
hear rather often that if an encryption scheme requires the algorithm
to remain a secret to be effective, it is not a worthwhile scheme... is
this just idle talk, or is the Administration bullshitting everyone?

With GREAT skepticism, and many doubts on our Administrations intentions...

And WAIT!! We haven't been told the NEXT gem the Administration has in
mind for e-mail and datafile security.  The press release does say that
this is part of a comprehensive thing on data security for us unprivileged
citizens.  Perhaps 'subjects' would be the better term - 'citizens'
somehow does not seem appropriate... that implies a free people, 'subjects'
better fits a population who serve at the pleasure of their rulers.
One thing for certain:  The government no longer regards the citizens
as their bosses anymore, but the other way around...

The point you all seem to have missed was covered when the UK cellphone
scrambling system was discussed.  Incidentally, my MP has responded to
my questions on that issue, and it appears that the UK and other `approved'
countries will get the secure A5 encryption, and `dodgy' countries will
get A5X.  Existing mobile equipment will drop to clear mode when used with
A5X systems, but newer equipment will use A5/A5X/clear depending on the
capabilities of the base station.

The cops/feds do *not* need to be able to get hold of your private key to
listen in to cellular conversations.  Encryption is not end-to-end, but 
cellphone to base-station - it *has* to be this way so that cellular users
and fixed installations can talk to each other.  For cellular to cellular
calls, the transmission is decrypted at the base-station, passed to another
base-station and re-encrypted.  The cops/feds can listen to the unscrambled
call *provided* they get a warrant to tap into the cellular provider's
equipment.  The only reason for wanting a crackable system is so they can
listen without having to obtain a warrant.

But, maybe the Clipper system is secure, and they really do need a warrant
to get the key out of escrow before they can listen in using a scanner (see
above - they don't *have* to go down this route anyway).  I have my doubts,
but even if true once they have the key they will *never* again need a
warrant to tap into that particular phone whenever they want.  `Well, Judge,
it appears he wasn't a drug-dealer after all, so naturally we'll stop
listening in'...

You have every reason to be scared shitless.  Take a look at the records
of McCarthy, Hoover (J. Edgar, not the cleaner - though they both excelled at
sucking) and Nixon.

   I suspect that this clipper thing could backfire on the Gov in a
big hurry. I expect that products using these chips will socket them
rather than soldering them, since once the keys are handed over by the
escrow agencies, the chip is so much garbage, and will need to be
replaced. I expect that someone will come along with a pin compatible
chip that uses secure encryption -- possibly even disguised so that it's
not possible to tell it from the clipper chip until you try to use the
2 backdoor keys.

   If I were to manufacture such a chip, as part of my marketing
strategy, I would try to subvert one or both escrow agencies either
through bribes or industrial espionage -- and then publicize the fact.
(doing my best not to be connected with such activities -- which would
likely not be legal :-) Publicly discrediting the escrow agencies would
go quite far towards creating a market for a secure alternative.

  I also believe that someone will reverse engineer the clipper chip,
and knowlege of the algorithm will likely be fairly widespread. Any back-
doors or weaknesses would further discredit the scheme, and help grow
the market demand for a secure alternative.

 I believe that the company that provides such an alternative will make
few friends in the LE community, but lots of money. I also believe that
the government will do it's best to make such plug replacements illegal.
I expect that they will see the same success in limiting the availability
of such alternatives as they have seen in limiting the availability of
certain illicit drugs -- ie. little to none.

Just a question. 
As a provider of a public BBS service - aren't you bound by law to gurantee
intelligble access to the data of the users on the BBS, if police comes
with sufficent authorisation ? I guessed this would be  a basic condition
for such systems. (I did run a bbs some time ago, but that was in Switzerland)

Another objection occurred to me.  There was a comment about how
supposedly there would only be one decode box, operated by the FBI.
This is flat ridiculous, and I don't believe it for a millisecond.
Even *if* they in fact only build one (or two or some other small
number) of these, that won't stop others from building one.  Make
it work like two Clipper-chip phones, one listening to each side
of the recorded conversation.  I'll have to have another look at
the specs posted so far, but offhand I didn't see anything that
would preclude this sort of thing.....

I feel like Winston Churchill in 1941 :( ...... but,

That sounds like an old _Dragnet_ episode.

  "Joe and I went to the apartment of Prime Suspect.  Nobody answered the
  door, but his landlord gave us permission to search the apartment."

Perhaps that worked in California in the 60's, but as I understand the
law landlords do _not_ have authority to grant permission to search space
rented by a third party, provided the lease is not in default, etc.
(I'm not even sure if they can provide the master key, when shown a search
warrant, since the _subject_ of the search is supposed to be notified).

At this point the question becomes: did the user "rent" the disk space
her encrypted file occupies?  If she did, it _should_ fall under the same
body of case law that applies to apartments, storage lockers, etc.  (As
to whether any court would recognize this fact....)  If she did not (i.e.,
no compensation exchanged), I don't know how it would be treated -- there
doesn't seem to be a non-cyberspace equivalent.

Unless there has been a _major_ change in the law, there's no such beast
as a "classified patent."  Patents exist to encourage communications and
develop the state of the art. 

(The 17-year lock is a nuisance, but historically has been pretty trivial.
It's only in an industry which doubles performance every three years (or
18 months, for some hardware) that 17 years is an eternity).

The same thing applies in civilian development: you can't patent something 
_and_ declare it a "trade secret."  However, you can (and should) mark all
software (including proprietary code) "unpublished copyright" so that it
ever does get exposed you still have some legal protection.

(Post-Berne this isn't required, since everything is "born copyrighted."
But it takes a while for people to learn the new rules).

The following document summarizes the Clipper Chip, how it is used,
how programming of the chip is coupled to key generation and the
escrow process, and how law enforcement decrypts communications.
Since there has been some speculation on this news group about my
own involvement in this project, I'd like to add that I was not in
any way involved.  I found out about it when the FBI briefed me on
Thursday evening, April 15.  Since then I have spent considerable
time talking with the NSA and FBI to learn more about this, and I
attended the NIST briefing at the Department of Commerce on April 16.  
The document below is the result of that effort. 

Dorothy Denning
---------------

                     THE CLIPPER CHIP: A TECHNICAL SUMMARY

                               Dorothy Denning

                                April 19, 1993


INTRODUCTION

On April 16, the President announced a new initiative that will bring
together the Federal Government and industry in a voluntary program
to provide secure communications while meeting the legitimate needs of
law enforcement.  At the heart of the plan is a new tamper-proof encryption
chip called the "Clipper Chip" together with a split-key approach to
escrowing keys.  Two escrow agencies are used, and the key parts from
both are needed to reconstruct a key.


CHIP STRUCTURE

The Clipper Chip contains a classified 64-bit block encryption
algorithm called "Skipjack."  The algorithm uses 80 bit keys (compared
with 56 for the DES) and has 32 rounds of scrambling (compared with 16
for the DES).  It supports all 4 DES modes of operation.  Throughput is
16 Mbits a second.

Each chip includes the following components:

   the Skipjack encryption algorithm
   F, an 80-bit family key that is common to all chips
   N, a 30-bit serial number
   U, an 80-bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip


ENCRYPTING WITH THE CHIP

To see how the chip is used, imagine that it is embedded in the AT&T
telephone security device (as it will be).  Suppose I call someone and
we both have such a device.  After pushing a button to start a secure
conversation, my security device will negotiate a session key K with
the device at the other end (in general, any method of key exchange can
be used).  The key K and message stream M (i.e., digitized voice) are then
fed into the Clipper Chip to produce two values:

   E[M; K], the encrypted message stream, and 
   E[E[K; U] + N; F], a law enforcement block.  

The law enforcement block thus contains the session key K encrypted
under the unit key U concatenated with the serial number N, all
encrypted under the family key F.


CHIP PROGRAMMING AND ESCROW

All Clipper Chips are programmed inside a SCIF (secure computer
information facility), which is essentially a vault.  The SCIF contains
a laptop computer and equipment to program the chips.  About 300 chips
are programmed during a single session.  The SCIF is located at
Mikotronx.

At the beginning of a session, a trusted agent from each of the two key
escrow agencies enters the vault.  Agent 1 enters an 80-bit value S1
into the laptop and agent 2 enters an 80-bit value S2. These values
serve as seeds to generate keys for a sequence of serial numbers.

To generate the unit key for a serial number N, the 30-bit value N is
first padded with a fixed 34-bit block to produce a 64-bit block N1.
S1 and S2 are then used as keys to triple-encrypt N1, producing a
64-bit block R1:

        R1 = E[D[E[N1; S1]; S2]; S1] .

Similarly, N is padded with two other 34-bit blocks to produce N2 and
N3, and two additional 64-bit blocks R2 and R3 are computed:  

        R2 = E[D[E[N2; S1]; S2]; S1] 
        R3 = E[D[E[N3; S1]; S2]; S1] .

R1, R2, and R3 are then concatenated together, giving 192 bits. The
first 80 bits are assigned to U1 and the second 80 bits to U2.  The
rest are discarded.  The unit key U is the XOR of U1 and U2.  U1 and U2
are the key parts that are separately escrowed with the two escrow
agencies.

As a sequence of values for U1, U2, and U are generated, they are
written onto three separate floppy disks.  The first disk contains a
file for each serial number that contains the corresponding key part
U1.  The second disk is similar but contains the U2 values.  The third
disk contains the unit keys U.  Agent 1 takes the first disk and agent
2 takes the second disk.  The third disk is used to program the chips.
After the chips are programmed, all information is discarded from the
vault and the agents leave.  The laptop may be destroyed for additional
assurance that no information is left behind.
 
The protocol may be changed slightly so that four people are in the
room instead of two.  The first two would provide the seeds S1 and S2,
and the second two (the escrow agents) would take the disks back to
the escrow agencies.

The escrow agencies have as yet to be determined, but they will not
be the NSA, CIA, FBI, or any other law enforcement agency.  One or
both may be independent from the government.


LAW ENFORCEMENT USE

When law enforcement has been authorized to tap an encrypted line, they
will first take the warrant to the service provider in order to get
access to the communications line.  Let us assume that the tap is in
place and that they have determined that the line is encrypted with
Clipper.  They will first decrypt the law enforcement block with the
family key F.  This gives them E[K; U] + N.  They will then take a
warrant identifying the chip serial number N to each of the key escrow
agents and get back U1 and U2.  U1 and U2 are XORed together to produce
the unit key U, and E[K; U] is decrypted to get the session key K.
Finally the message stream is decrypted.  All this will be accomplished
through a special black box decoder operated by the FBI.


ACKNOWLEDGMENT AND DISTRIBUTION NOTICE.  All information is based on

I would think that you could reduce the defense of using non-clipper
based encryption technologies to defending freedom of expression 
(IE, free speech).  That you have to right to express whatever you
want in whatever form your little heart desires so long as you do
not impinge on the rights of others.

Encrypted text/sound/video is just another form of expression of that
particular text/sound/video.  Just like digitized sound is another 
means of expression of sound -- streams of 100100101111 instead of
continuous waveforms.

Also, it shouldn't be up to the government at all.  Encryption 
_Standards_ can be decided upon by Independent Standards Orgainizations
(apologies for the acronym).  One can note how well this has worked
with ISO and the Metric System, SAE, etc.  Independent entities 
or consortia of people/industries in that particular area are far
more qualified to set standards than any One government agency.
Consider for example what the Ascii character set would have looked
like if it was decided by the government.

I hope this helps folks to formulate their defenses.  I'm still working
on mine and hope to be faxing my congressmen soon...

Here are two quotes from the White House.

``The Administration is not saying, "since encryption threatens the
public safety and effective law enforcement, we will prohibit it
outright" (as some countries have effectively done); nor is the U.S.
saying that "every American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an
unbreakable commercial encryption product."''

``In making this decision, I do not intend to prevent the private
sector from developing, or the government from approving, other
microcircuits or algorithms that are equally effective in assuring
both privacy and a secure key-escrow system.''

These quotes bother me in three ways. (1) Many people will read and
remember that ``encryption threatens the public safety and effective
law enforcement.'' (2) The Administration is explicitly failing to
acknowledge that every American is entitled to use strong encryption
to ensure his own privacy. (3) The President, by implication, may
intend to outlaw any cryptographic devices which ensure privacy but
do not have a key-escrow system.

I want to see an organization which will combat such statements.
Encryption does _not_ threaten the public safety, any more than ski
masks do. Every American _is_ entitled to use strong encryption which
ensures his own privacy and is _not_ crippled by a key-escrow system.
I guess I'm looking for a ``League for Cryptographic Freedom.'' Or a
``National Cryptography Association.''

To what extent does the EFF serve this purpose? Is a new organization
necessary? Does it already exist?

---Dan


Clipper might be a good way to cover the use of another layer of
encryption.

Currently, when you send an encrypted message, an opponent can usually
tell 1) that you are using encryption 2) which encryption method you
are using [because that information is usually in the clear].

With clipper, most opponents will only know that you are sending
clipper-text, they won't know that your clipper-text is itself
encoded.

Only those few opponents who get your clipper-keys will know
that your message is double encrypted.

... kind of like a safety deposit box containing a lock box.

So, don't just think of replacements for clipper, also think of front
ends.

Even if what Brad says turns out to be accurate, you can bet that the
Administration will have made it "very clear" to the vendors that "it
would very much be in their best interests" to institute a "voluntary"
policy of refusing to sell anything but Clinton Cripple equipped equipment
to anyone other than "Authorized government agencies and Law Enforcement",
or individuals and corporations who "have been been determined by the
Administration to have a valid need on a case-by-case basis" for an
effective system.

Note that this is very much like the language used in many gun control
bills/laws the Administration is pushing for, or otherwise supporting.
The logic and actual rationale (as opposed to the excuses that get fed
to the media) is the same in both cases, only the items or technology
in question are different.

I think this is no accident.  It comes from the same philosophy that
the government rules/controls the people, not the people controlling
the government, that the unconnected citizens are not sophisticated enough
to know what is best for them, so the government must tell the people
what they need or do not need ... "we know best...".  And the idea that
that a commoner can defend himself against government eavesdropping
or unlawful attack is totally unacceptable to people with this outlook.

Combine this all with pushing for national identity cards with 'smart
chips' to encode anything they please (internal passport) under the
guise of streamlining the State People's Health Care System, and with
(you can be certain) more jewels yet to come, and one sees an extremely
ominous trend.  So what if "1984" will be ten years late... it still is
turning out to be an amazingly accurate prophecy... unless a LOT of
people wake up, and in a hurry.

One should ALWAYS have every red warning light and bell and danger flag
come up when the government seeks to set itself apart in regard to
rights, etc.  from the unconnected/unprivileged citizen (or should we
now be saying 'subject' instead?)...  Why SHOULDN'T the average person
have a good, secure system of data security, not dependent on nebulous
'safeguards' for maintaining that security?  Why SHOULDN'T the average
person be able to defend himself from an agency gone rogue?  0I am sure
the Feds could break into any data they really wanted to (but it would
take some WORK), and using the same logic, one should not be allowed to
have a good safe, unless a duplicate of the key(s) or combination are
submitted for 'safekeeping' by the government?  I don't really see a
difference, philosophically.  Encrypted data sure won't evaporate, not
with such high-tech tools as a TAPE RECORDER...

Ok, so there are in fact two distinct components transmitted by the
chip; the real message encrypted with the "conventional" key, and the
serial number and encrypted "conventional" key encrypted with the
(IMHO kind of bogus, as the whole concept of "one key that millions of
people use which can't be changed" doesn't seem reasonable) "family
key".

Suppose I analyze the output of this chip and I'm able to determine
which bits are the encrypted packet which contains the serial number
and session key.  Suppose I also design a simple algorithm based on
this information which takes the data containing the encrypted session
key and twiddles a bit (or several) before it's sent down the line.

Mind you, I'm sure the NSA thought of this along with a dozen other
attacks I can't imagine, and the system is probably somehow designed
so that manipulation of this information will cause a compliant
receiving chip to somehow fail to decrypt successfully.  But how?
What if the two parties agree in advance on some kind of consistent
bit-twiddling scheme, so the decryption chip sees the restored
"proper" bitstream but an eavesdropper gets a E[K; UK] packet that's
wrong?

I suppose this could be easily defeated if the chip "sends" that
information out many times in slightly different ways, making it
effectively impossible to be certain you know all the information
being sent.

Laissez faire, laissez passer. Le monde va de lui meme.


Here is a disturbing thought.

Now, we no longer live in the days of big filing cabinets. We live in
the electronic age. I asked myself, how big could the escrow database
get? How hard might it be to steal the whole thing, particularly were
I an NSA official operating with the tacit permission of the escrow
houses? (We can pretend that such will not happen, but thats naive.)

Well, lets see. Ten bytes of each escrow half. Lets asume ten bytes of
serial number -- in fact, I believe the serial number is smaller, but
this is an order of magnitude calculation. We assume 250*10^6 as the
population, and that each person has a key. I get five gigabytes for
each of the two escrow databases. Fits conveniently on a single very
valuable Exabyte tape. This can only get easier with time, but who
cares -- I can already hold all the clipper keys in the country in my
pocket on two 8mm tapes.

Admittely, they will think of safeguards. They won't put the whole
database on one disk, prehaps. Maybe they will throw stumbling blocks
in the way. This changes nothing -- they keys will be needed every day
by hundreds if not thousands of law enforcement types, so convenience
will dictate that the system permit quick electronic retrieval. At
some point, with or without collusion by the agencies, those exabyte
tapes are going to get cut. Dorothy Denning and David Sternlight will
doubtless claim this can't happen -- but we know that "can't" is a
prayer, not a word that in this instance connotes realism.

With two exabyte tapes in your pocket, you would hold the keys for
every person's conversations in the country in your hands. Yeah, you
need the "master key" two -- but thats just ten bytes of information
that have to be stored an awful lot of places.

Come to think of it, even if the NSA getting a copy of the database
isn't a threat to you because unlike me you have no contraversial
political views, consider foreign intelligence services. You know, the
ones that David Sternlight wants to protect us from because of the
evil industrial espionage that they do. The French apparently do have
a big spying operation in friendly countries to get industrial
secrets, so he isn't being completely irrational here (although why
our companies couldn't use cryptosystems without back doors is left
unexplained by those that point out this threat.) 

Presumably, foreign intelligence services can get moles into the NSA
and other agencies. We have proof by example of this: its happened
many times. Presumably, someday they will get their hands on some
fraction of the keys. You can't avoid that sort of thing.

Don't pretend that no one unauthorized will ever get their hands on
the escrow databases.

We crypto types are all taught something very important at the
beginning of intro to cryptography -- security must depend on the
easily changed key that you pick to run your system, and not on a
secret. The escrow databases aren't the sorts of secrets that our
teachers told us about, but they are the sort of big secrets they
would lump into this category. Imagine trying to replace 100 million
Clipper chips.

I cannot believe that the NSA or whomever it is thats doing this
doesn't realize all this already. They are too smart. There are too
many of them who have made their bones in the real world. I suspect
that they know precisely what they are doing -- and that what they are
doing is giving us the appearance of safety so that they can continue
to surveil in spite of the growth of strong cryptography. I suspect
that they realize that they can't put things off forever, but they can
try to delay things as long as possible.

Who knows. Maybe even some of the higher ups, the inevitable
bureaucratic types that rise in any organization, really do believe
that this scheme might give people some security, even as their
subordinates in Fort Meade wring their hands over the foolishness of
it all.

The Supreme Court seems to disagree with you -- they have stated that
"the people" is a term of art refering to an individual right, and
have explicitly mentioned the second amendment as an example.

I quote:

  "... 'the people' seems to have been a term of art employed in
  select parts of the Constitution.  The Preamble declares that the
  Constitution is ordained, and established by 'the people of the
  the U.S.'  The Second Amendment protects the right of the people
  to keep and bear Arms ...."
	- Supreme Court of the U.S.,  U.S. v. Uerdugo-Uriquidez (1990).

Furthermore, in the Miller decision, they only permitted prosecution
for possession of a sawed-off shotgun because the defense had not
presented testimony and they therefore accepted the argument of the
government that such weapons have no military value -- they held that
the amendment protected the individual right to possess military
weapons. Unfortunately, no second amendment case has successfully
gotten to the court in fifty years. However, that does not change the
interpretation.

Furthermore, it appears that others disagree with you as well, vis:

 "The conclusion is thus inescapable that the history, concept,
  and wording of the Second Amendment to the Constitution of the
  United States, as well as its interpretation by every major
  commentator and court in the first half-century after its ratifi-
  cation, indicates that what is protected is an individual right
  of a private citizen to own and carry firearms in a peaceful manner."
   - Report of the Subcommittee on the Constitution of the
     Committee on the Judiciary, United States Senate,
     97th Congress, Second Session ( February 1982 )

You might rightfully ask "well then, what does that first bit about
militias mean?"

Well, "militia" in historical context basically means the whole of the
adult males of the country. (Indeed, the U.S. Code still defines
"militia" as all armed men over the age of 17).

   "The Militia comprised all males physically capable of acting
    in concert for the common defense ....  And ... these men were
    expected to appear bearing arms supplied by themselves and of
    the kind in common use at the time."
	- Supreme Court of the United States,  U.S. v. Miller (1939).

The reason for the phrase being there was to explain the rationale
behind the amendment, which was this: by depending on the people to
bear arms in defense of the country, no centralization of military
power could ever occur which would permit tyranny -- in short, the
government would remain perpetually in fear of the people, rather than
the other way around.

   "No free man shall ever be debarred the use of arms.  The strongest reason
   for the people to retain the right to keep and bear arms is, as a last
   resort, to protect themselves against tyranny in government."
     - Thomas Jefferson, Proposal Virginia Constitution, June 1776
       1 Thomas Jefferson Papers, 334 (C. J. Boyd, Ed., 1950).

   "And what country can preserve its liberties, if its rulers are not
   warned from time to time that this people preserve the spirit of
   resistance ?  Let them take arms ... The tree of liberty must be
   refreshed from time to time, with the blood of patriots and tyrants."
     - Thomas Jefferson (letter to William S. Smith, 1787, in
       Jefferson, On Democracy 20, S. Padover, ed., 1939).

   "Before a standing army can rule, the people must be disarmed;
   as they are in almost every kingdom of Europe.  The supreme
   power in America cannot enforce unjust laws by the sword;
   because the whole body of the people are armed, and constitute
   a force superior to any bands of regular troops that can be, on
   any pretense, raised in the United States."
     - Noah Webster, "An Examination into the Leading Principles
       of the Federal Constitution" (1787), in Pamphlets on the
       Constitution of the United States (P. Ford, 1888).

You may disagree with the second amendment, and wish that it be
repealed, but please do not pretend that it isn't there and that it
doesn't mean what it says. You might argue that conditions have
changed and that it should no longer be present, but you can't imagine
it away.

I could fill a book with detailed argumentation. Many have already.

However, none of this has anything to do with cryptography.  Lets get
it out of here. If you insist on discussing this, please do it in
talk.politics.guns, where people will gladly discuss this matter with
you.

And the initiative for actual implementation.  Clinton is not just an

Other alternatives include output of vmstat, iostat, pstat and friends

e.g. on an RS/6000 (AIX 3.2) you can get lots of relatively

Doesn't this just mean that the government might not approve
something for use by other government agencies.  This does not
sound to me to be any form of threat that Joe User can't develop
and use his own encryption algorithm.

If the Clipper chip can do cheap crypto for the masses, obviously one
could do the same thing WITHOUT building in back doors.

Indeed, even without special engineering, you can construct a good
system right now. A standard codec chip, a chip to do vocoding, a DES
chip, a V32bis integrated modem module, and a small processor to do
glue work, are all you need to have a secure phone. You can dump one
or more of the above if you have a fast processor. With integration,
you could put all of them onto a single chip -- and in the future they
can be.

Yes, cheap crypto is good -- but we don't need it from the government.
You can do everything the clipper chip can do without needing it to be
compromised. When the White House releases stuff saying "this is good
because it gives people privacy", note that we didn't need them to
give us privacy, the capability is available using commercial hardware
right now.

Indeed, were it not for the government doing everything possible to
stop them, Qualcomm would have designed strong encryption right in to
the CDMA cellular phone system they are pioneering. Were it not for
the NSA and company, cheap encryption systems would be everywhere. As
it is, they try every trick in the book to stop it. Had it not been
for them, I'm sure cheap secure phones would be out right now.

They aren't the ones making cheap crypto available. They are the ones
keeping cheap crypto out of people's hands. When they hand you a
clipper chip, what you are getting is a mess of pottage -- your prize
for having traded in your birthright.

And what did we buy with our birthright? Did we get safety from
foreigners? No. They can read conference papers as well as anyone else
and are using strong cryptography. Did we get safety from professional
terrorists? I suspect that they can get cryptosystems themselves on
the open market that work just fine -- most of them can't be idiots
like the guys that bombed the trade center. Are we getting cheaper
crypto for ourselves? No, because the market would have provided that
on its own had they not deliberately sabotaged it.

Someone please tell me what exactly we get in our social contract in
exchange for giving up our right to strong cryptography?

Here are two quotes from the White House.

``The Administration is not saying, "since encryption threatens the
public safety and effective law enforcement, we will prohibit it
outright" (as some countries have effectively done); nor is the U.S.
saying that "every American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an
unbreakable commercial encryption product."''

``In making this decision, I do not intend to prevent the private
sector from developing, or the government from approving, other
microcircuits or algorithms that are equally effective in assuring
both privacy and a secure key-escrow system.''

These quotes bother me in three ways. (1) Many people will read and
remember that ``encryption threatens the public safety and effective
law enforcement.'' (2) The Administration is explicitly failing to
acknowledge that every American is entitled to use strong encryption
to ensure his own privacy. (3) The President, by implication, may
intend to outlaw any cryptographic devices which ensure privacy but
do not have a key-escrow system.

I want to see an organization which will combat such statements.
Encryption does _not_ threaten the public safety, any more than ski
masks do. Every American _is_ entitled to use strong encryption which
ensures his own privacy and is _not_ crippled by a key-escrow system.
I guess I'm looking for a ``League for Cryptographic Freedom.'' Or a
``National Cryptography Association.''

To what extent does the EFF serve this purpose? Is a new organization
necessary? Does it already exist?

The chip and algorithm are classified.  If you reverse engineer it and
tell people, you are likely to go to jail.

Perhaps some foreign governments or corporations could help us out by
cracking the system outside the USA.  The US government could probably
stop importation of clone hardware, but a software implementation
should be practical.

Why do we hackers care about the Clipper chip?  Do we give a shit
about anybody's privacy accept our own?  And perhaps not even our
own; are we so smart that we always know when we're talking to
somebody who has a wiretap on their phone?

I find the "call thru your computer" ideas may reflect this attitude.
Ideas that are of, by, and for hackers, and don't help anybody in the
real world, aren't going to do anybody much good, including ourselves
where voice phones are concerned.

We *do* need an alternative to NSA-bugged telephones, but
we're talking inexpensive *telephones* here, including hand-sized
cellulars, that need strong crypto, real privacy.  Make-shift
computer hacker rigs that require living by your computer to
talk privately over the phone are just a dumb stunt that doesn't 
do anything for anybody's privacy in the real world.  

What we need is a true *privacy chip*.  For example, a real-time 
voice-encryption RSA, silicon compile it and spit out ASIC.  
Put this chip on the market as a de facto standard for international 
business, diplomats, and private communications.  If the U.S. bans 
it, we make it somewhere else and import it.  The Japanese, German,
Dutch, Taiwanese, Korean, etc. electronics companies don't want the 
NSA spying on them.  U.S. workers lose more jobs to government fascist
stupidity.

  Simple -- if you have a choice between:

 1. American manufacturers peddling Cripple Chips with a secret untested
     algorithm whose keys are held by people with a history of untrustworthy
     behavoir, or

 2. Japanese (to pick the obvious example) manufacturers peddling encryption
     chips with an algorithm that has faced public scrutiny and keys under
     the control of the user,

which would you choose?  At most, the American government can deny this
choice to American citizens (and probably not that, if the glorious success
of the War on Drugs is any example); it can't do much about the global market.

   Each chip includes the following components:

      the Skipjack encryption algorithm
      F, an 80-bit family key that is common to all chips
      N, a 30-bit serial number
      U, an 80-bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip

Hmmm. A thirty bit serial number. And, we are told, the unit key U is
derived deterministically from this serial number. That means that
there are only one billion possible unit keys.

   To generate the unit key for a serial number N, the 30-bit value N is
   first padded with a fixed 34-bit block to produce a 64-bit block N1.
   S1 and S2 are then used as keys to triple-encrypt N1, producing a
   64-bit block R1:

	   R1 = E[D[E[N1; S1]; S2]; S1] .

   Similarly, N is padded with two other 34-bit blocks to produce N2 and
   N3, and two additional 64-bit blocks R2 and R3 are computed:  

	   R2 = E[D[E[N2; S1]; S2]; S1] 
	   R3 = E[D[E[N3; S1]; S2]; S1] .

   R1, R2, and R3 are then concatenated together, giving 192 bits. The
   first 80 bits are assigned to U1 and the second 80 bits to U2.  The
   rest are discarded.  The unit key U is the XOR of U1 and U2.  U1 and U2
   are the key parts that are separately escrowed with the two escrow
   agencies.

Hmmm. We must assume that generating the unit key U from the serial
number N rather than generating it from a randomly selected U1 and U2
is an intentional way of assuring a "fail safe" for the government --
U is completedly determined given S1, S2 and N. If S1 and S2 do not
change they constitute effective "master keys" (along with F), the
theft of which (or the possession of which by various authorities)
completely obviates the security of the system. However, more
interestingly, we know, for a fact that if S1 and S2 are fixed no
matter what the keyspace for U is no more than 2^30. Why not pick U1
and U2 at random? Why this interesting restriction of they key space
if it NOT to provide an additional back door?

I find it disturbing that at the very best my security is dependant on
approximately 30 bytes worth of information that could be written on
the back of a napkin.

Even if S1 and S2 change periodically, the rationale behind this
restriction in the size of the keyspace seems strange if one is
assuming that the goal is security -- and makes perfect sense if the
goal is an illusion of security.

If S1 and S2 do not change, even if they remain secret I wonder if
they can somehow be back-derived given enough unit key/serial number
pairs. We are assured that this cannot happen -- but no one
understands how Skipjack works outside of government officials and,
soon, foreign intelligence services that gain the information via
espionage. Presumably we will eventually have the information as well
-- reverse engineering gets more and more advanced every year -- but
by the time we know it may be too late.

   As a sequence of values for U1, U2, and U are generated, they are
   written onto three separate floppy disks.  The first disk contains a
   file for each serial number that contains the corresponding key part
   U1.  The second disk is similar but contains the U2 values.  The third
   disk contains the unit keys U.  Agent 1 takes the first disk and agent
   2 takes the second disk.  The third disk is used to program the chips.
   After the chips are programmed, all information is discarded from the
   vault and the agents leave.  The laptop may be destroyed for additional
   assurance that no information is left behind.

None of this makes me feel the least bit secure. The silly notion of
"destroying the laptop" appears to be yet another bizarre distraction.
We all know that you can't read data from DRAM that has been turned
off for more than a few moments. On the other hand, what we don't know
is why there is a need to generate the unit keys from S1 and S2 in the
first place other than to weaken the system. We don't know if the
agents in question would resist a million in cash a piece for their
information -- its probably worth hundreds of million, so you can make
the bribe arbitrarily hard to resist. And to tell you the truth, doing
this in a "vault" rather than in Joe Random Tempest-shielded Room
with a laptop computer seems like melodrama designed to make
high-school dropouts from Peoria impressed -- but it does very little
for most of the rest of us.

   The protocol may be changed slightly so that four people are in the
   room instead of two.  The first two would provide the seeds S1 and S2,
   and the second two (the escrow agents) would take the disks back to
   the escrow agencies.

What would this provide? Lets say the escrow agencies are the ACLU and
the NRA and their agents personally take back the disks and are always
honest. Who cares? The NSA must be laughing out loud, because they
have the algorithm to regenerate U given N and likely don't need to
steal they keys as they effectively already have them.

Oh, but can Big Brother afford such things in these times of tight
budgets?

I don't know how many folks noticed it, but Dorothy "Trust Me" Denning gave
a real clue to the current state of the art at NSA on decrypto machines when
she said the NSA told her they didn't even want to be the holder of any
part of the key.  

Now why is that?  I doubt there is a trapdoor in Skipjack.  (But we will
never know).  And I doubt the NSA would promote a mass market chip they
couldn't compromise.  Ergo, NSA is now capable of compromising (probably
with brute force keysearch) engines of the complexity of Skipjack.  Look
at the specs.  Why, I bet they have thousands of little chips chugging
away in their crypto busters... Maybe even tens of thousands.  Complexity?
Not much more than a 3090.  How many such machines will fit into Fort Meade?

I think PGP2.3 should have 256 bit IDEA keys...

	Let's assume, for the moment, that the system really is secure unless
	you get both halves of the encryption key from the two independent
	escrow houses.  Let's say you even trust the escrow houses -- one is
	the ACLU and the other is the EFF.  (And I'm not entirely joking about
	those two names)

I'm really not entirely sure I trust EFF any more to be honest.

Anyway, any organisation can be deeply infiltrated.  Look at CND in Britain
a dozen years ago - one of their top members was an SIS spy who stole their
complete address list.  How hard would it be to get one person to sneak in
and copy the escrow data to disk?

They don't have to track customer lists - they merely have to digitally
listen to any phone line and eliminate any that don't have the clipper
header/signature.  (No-one has said how it will be modulated - want a bet
it's a non-standard and hence easily recognisable baudrate?)

Devices to scan exchanges and detect modems etc already exist.  I've seen
them advertised in the trade press.

Once you eliminate crippled crypto devices and ordinary data modems, what's
left is crypto worth looking more closely at.  I guess any substitute scheme
will have to be v32bis or v.fast to disguise it, though then they just start
looking at the data too...

Whatever happens though, the effect of this new chip will be to make private
crypto stand out like a sore thumb.

Hmm, here are a couple:

1) If the algorithm becomes known, it will be easy to produce
pin-compatible non-crippled chips that provide -real- encryption and
privacy, because their keys are only in their users' hands.

2) Since SkipJack is a symmetric key cypher, it needs some way to
agree on a session key. The released information says that any
protocol may be used (e.g., DH). From a theoretical point of view,
this is probably true. However, from a practical point of view, those
chips must have some kind of key exchange protocol built-in. What if
it is good old RSA? This will mean that the producer will have to pay
lots of bucks to PKP. By keeping the details secret this can be
avoided...

The US doesn't yet have many laws covering BBSs - they're not common carriers,
they're not phone companies, they're just private machines or services
operated by businesses.  There's no obligation to keep records.
As Perry Metzger points out, if the police come with a search warrant,
you have to let them see what the warrant demands, if it exists,
and they generally can confiscate the equipment as "evidence"
(which is not Constitutionally valid, but we're only beginning to
develop court cases supporting us).  A court MAY be able to compel
you to tell them information you know, such as the encryption password
for the disk - there aren't any definitive cases yet, since it's a new
situation, and there probably aren't laws specifically covering it.
But the court can't force you to *know* the keys, and there are no
laws preventing you from allowing your users to have their own keys
for their own files without giving them to you.

Even in areas that do have established law, there is uncertainty.
There was a guy in Idaho a few years ago who had his business records
subpoenaed as evidence for taxes or some other business-restriction law,
so he gave the court the records.  Which were in Hebrew.
The US doesn't have laws forcing you to keep your records in English,
and these were the originals of the records.  HE didn't speak Hebrew,
and neither did anybody in the court organization.  Don't think they
were able to do much about it.

It might be illegal for your BBS to deny access to potential customers
based on race, religion, national origin, gender, or sexual preference;
it probably hasn't been tested in court, but it seems like a plausible
extension of anti-discrimination laws affecting other businesses.

[Apologies for not posting to alt.clipper, or whatever, but it seems it
may not be in the newsfeed here.]

There may be another reason (good from NSA's point of view, horrible
from everyone else's) why the algorithm/chip design might be secret.

First, note that the "experts" will only look at "details", and of just 
the algorithm:

    In addition, respected experts from outside the
    government will be offered access to the confidential details of
    the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report
    their findings.

Why not the chip design?  Well, here's the possiblity:  in addition to
encryption, the chip pre-processes voice signals to make them easier
to analyze/transcribe electronically.  The chip, once widespread, might
effectively be part of a massively parallel computer for "voice-
grepping" the US phone network (or the criminal & wrong-thinking patrons
thereof).

I wouldn't put it past the NSA.  Think how much easier it would make life
for them.

And if this is indeed the case, think of the possible public outcry should
it become widely known.  Thus the secrecy.

It might be a good idea to have experts in DSP, voice recognition, and
AI conversation-understanding to be on that panel, and insist they be
given (authenticatable) design specs and implementation documentation.

Perhaps the trusted escrow agencies can be the ones who come up with
S1 and S2, and if these agencies are really trusted (ACLU & NRA is an
interesting example), we can hope that they'll use some physical
process to come up with truly random numbers. If the NSA comes up with
the numbers, that's a trap door you could drive a truck through.

April 16, 1993
Washington, DC

               COMPUTER PROFESSIONALS CALL FOR PUBLIC
           DEBATE ON NEW GOVERNMENT ENCRYPTION INITIATIVE

        Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility (CPSR)
today called for the public disclosure of technical data
underlying the government's newly-announced "Public Encryption
Management" initiative.  The new cryptography scheme was
announced today by the White House and the National Institute
for Standards and Technology (NIST), which will implement the
technical specifications of the plan.  A NIST spokesman
acknowledged that the National Security Agency (NSA), the super-
secret military intelligence agency, had actually developed the
encryption technology around which the new initiative is built.

        According to NIST, the technical specifications and the
Presidential directive establishing the plan are classified.  To
open the initiative to public review and debate, CPSR today
filed a series of Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests
with key agencies, including NSA, NIST, the National Security
Council and the FBI for information relating to the encryption
plan.  The CPSR requests are in keeping with the spirit of the
Computer Security Act, which Congress passed in 1987 in order to
open the development of non-military computer security standards
to public scrutiny and to limit NSA's role in the creation of
such standards.

        CPSR previously has questioned the role of NSA in
developing the so-called "digital signature standard" (DSS), a
communications authentication technology that NIST proposed for
government-wide use in 1991.  After CPSR sued NIST in a FOIA
lawsuit last year, the civilian agency disclosed for the first
time that NSA had, in fact, developed that security standard.
NSA is due to file papers in federal court next week justifying
the classification of records concerning its creation of the
DSS.

        David Sobel, CPSR Legal Counsel, called the
administration's apparent commitment to the privacy of
electronic communications, as reflected in today's official
statement,  "a step in the right direction."  But he questioned
the propriety of NSA's role in the process and the apparent
secrecy that has thus far shielded the development process from
public scrutiny.  "At a time when we are moving towards the
development of a new information infrastructure, it is vital
that standards designed to protect personal privacy be
established openly and with full public participation.  It is
not appropriate for NSA -- an agency with a long tradition of
secrecy and opposition to effective civilian cryptography -- to
play a leading role in the development process."

        CPSR is a national public-interest alliance of computer
industry professionals dedicated to examining the impact of
technology on society.   CPSR has 21 chapters in the U.S. and
maintains offices in Palo Alto, California, Cambridge,
Massachusetts and Washington, DC.  For additional information on

 So in a few years there could be millions of these chips in the USA, all
networked together? Sounds like a good science fiction story - the government
wants to crack foreign DES (or whatever) messages, so they con the public into
individually buying all of the components and installing them. Soon the US
could be covered by the largest parallel computer in the world, built on top of
our current phone net.

Summary: C functions to do arbitrary-precision arith
X-Newsreader: TIN [version 1.1 PL8]

This is the file BIGNUMS.TXT from ripem.msu.edu, last updated April 1993.

In response to Email requests, I have assembled this list of
large-integer arithmetic packages of which I have heard.
Most of these are C function libraries, available in source form.

For your convenience, I have placed copies of
some of these on ripem.msu.edu (35.8.1.178).  They are
available for anonymous FTP in the directory "pub/bignum".
However, what I have may not be the most current version in all cases.

Here they are, in no particular order:

mp
    Multiple Precision package that comes with some Unixes
    
    Multiple precision package accessed via -lmp flag on your
    compiler.  Provides +, -, *, /, gcd, exponentiation,
    sqrt.  Comes with SunOS, NeXT Mach, BBN Mach 1000, 
    and probably a few others.  See "man mp".  
    Object code only, of course.

PARI
    Henri Cohen, et al., Universite Bordeaux I, Paris, FRANCE
    
    Multiple precision desk calculator and library routines.
    Contains optimized assembly code for Motorola 68020, 
    semi-optimized code for SPARC, and apparently rather slow
    generic C version.  Does both integers and reals.
    Does vectors and matrices as well as scalars.
    Contains a number of advanced functions, some of which I've
    never heard of.  ("Weber's function"?)
    Has a factorization function, primality test, & other related stuff.
    Plenty of TEX documentation.
    Public domain, but you can't distribute modified versions.
    Available via anonymous FTP from math.ucla.edu.  There seem to
    be Mac- and NeXT-specific versions there in addition to:
    Filename:  pari-1.35a.tar.Z
    
Arithmetic in Global Fields  (Arith)
    Kevin R. Coombes, David R. Grant
    
    Package of routines for arbitrary precision integers or
    polynomials over finite fields.  Includes basic +, -, *, /
    and a few others like gcd.  Source code in C.
    Distributed under the terms of the GNU public license.
    Includes man pages and TEX documentation.
    Filename:  arith.tar.Z

Arbitrary Precision Math Library
    Lloyd Zusman   Los Gatos, CA
    
    C package which supports basic +, -, *, /.  Provides for radix
    points (i.e., non-integers).  Not as polished as the others here.
    Posted to comp.sources.misc in October 1988.
    Filename:  apml.tar.Z
    
BigNum
    J. Vuillemin, INRIA, FRANCE, and others.
    Distributed by Digital Equipment Paris Research Lab (DECPRL)
    
    A "portable and efficient arbitrary-precision integer" package.
    C code, with generic C "kernel", plus assembly "kernels" for
    MC680x0, Intel i960, MIPS, NS32032, Pyramid, and of course VAX.
    This is probably one of the better-known packages of this type.
    Implements +, -, *, /, mod, plus logical operations OR, AND, XOR.
    Both signed and unsigned arithmetic available.
    Available via email from librarian@decprl.dec.com.
    You will receive 5 shell archives.  Give your postal address
    and you will also receive printed documentation from France.
    Package includes TEX documentation.
    Publicly available for non-commercial use.
    I removed this from my archive when I heard a rumor that PRL
    doesn't like others to distribute it.  However, BIGNUM *is*
    distributed as part of ecpp (see below).

Lenstra's package
    Arjen Lenstra   Bellcore
    
    Portable unsigned integer package written entirely in C.
    Includes +, -, *, /, exponentiation, mod, primality testing,
    sqrt, random number generator, and a few others.  The package
    was uncommented and undocumented; I have tried to add enough
    comments to get by.  This is the only of these packages that I
    have actually used.  It works well and is very portable.  
    I haven't done any benchmarks against the others, but the code 
    looks clever & Lenstra is an accomplished number theorist.
    Unlike the other packages here, this one requires you to allocate
    storage statically--only a problem if your numbers are really huge.
    Arjen has placed the code in the public domain.  
    Filename:  lenstra.tar.Z

lenstra_3.1
    Arjen Lenstra,  Bellcore

    An improved version of Arjen's package above.  This one
    does signed arithmetic and dynamic allocation (which can be turned
    off as an option). Has a few new routines, too.  "lenstra_3.1" contains
    minor bugfixes to the previously-available "lenstra_2" and "lenstra_3".
    Filename:  lenstra_3.1.c

bmp  (Brent's Multiple Precision?)
    R. P. Brent

    1981 vintage FORTRAN code to do extended precision floating &
    fixed point arithmetic.  Includes most of the mathematical
    functions you'd find in a FORTRAN run-time library.
    This code is an ACM algorithm, number 524.
    To obtain, send a mail message to  netlib@ornl.gov
    containing the line "send mp.f from bmp" or better yet, perhaps
    just start with "help".

SPX
    Kannan Alagappan & Joseph Tardo, DEC
    
    This is a huge prototype public key authentication system
    based on RSA.  I mention it here because those who have heard
    of SPX have probably correctly guessed that it contains a large
    integer package and I want to inform you that the large integer
    package it contains is indeed DEC's BigNum from France.
    You can get a beta test copy of SPX from crl.dec.com (192.58.206.2). 
    Use it only for testing, as it "may" expire on a certain date.
    (I don't know whether this has expired yet.)

amp  (Antti's Multiple Precision?)
    Antti Louko   alo@kampi.hut.fi

    Multiple precision integer package in C.  Includes +, -, *, /, %,
    pow, mod, 1/x mod y, random, sqrt, gcd.  Available for non-commercial
    use.  The package includes "share-secret", a public key system based
    on the Diffie-Hellman algorithm.
    This is normally part of the well-known "des-dist.tar.Z",
    but I have removed the DES part to avoid having to deal with 
    cryptographic export laws, and have named the result:
    Filename:  amp.tar.Z

gennum  
    Per Bothner   U of Wisconsin-Madison

    C++ routines and classes to do generic arithmetic, both
    integer and rational.  
    Formerly available on sevenlayer.cs.wis.edu.  However, it
    seems to have disappeared.  Sorry.

MIRACL
    (By someone in Dublin, Ireland)

    Integer and fractional multiple precision package.
    Includes factorization, primality testing, encryption.
    Not public domain, apparently.  It is available from the Austin
    Code Works.  (See ads in Byte Magazine or Dr. Dobbs.)

precision
    Dave Barrett  barrettd@tigger.colorado.edu

    Multiple precision integer package in C with +,-,*,/, sqrt, rand,
    mod, pow, log.  Simple vector support.  Does dynamic allocation of memory.
    Free as long as you don't sell it or any program that uses it.
    Filename:  precision.tar.Z

UBASIC
    Prof. Yuji Kida, Rikkyo University, Nishi-Ikebukuro 3, Tokyo 171, Japan
    kida@rkmath.rikkyo.ac.jp

    Multiple-precision version of the BASIC programming language,
    for MS-DOS.  Includes floating point.  Said (by Keith Briggs)
    to be pretty fast.  Object only, I think.  ervin@morekypr.bitnet
    says:  "This is the best package that I know of for
    fast arithmetic.  Has a version optimized for 386 machines.  Includes
    routines to do MPQS, the fastest currently known general factoring
    algorithm.  An additional file is at both sites to allow MPQS to use
    hard drives so that it can factor up to 80 digits.  Many number
    theoretical functions are included in UBASIC.  It allows over 2500
    digits of precision."

    Henrik.Johansson@Nexus.Comm.SE

    Bignum package written in portable C.  Will in the future
    conform to the Common Lisp functions that handles integers.
    Currently includes +, -, *, /, exponentiation, "exptmod",
    comparison, random numbers, and gcd.
    Filename: bignum-1.2

GNU Multiple Precision
    GNU (Free Software Foundation) multiple precision package.
    I haven't looked at it yet.  This is current as of April 1992,
    but there may be a more recent version by the time you read

PGP (Pretty Good Privacy)
    Philip Zimmermann   prz@sage.cgd.ucar.EDU

    Intel-based crypto package that includes bignum routines in C,
    said to be quite fast for Intel processors.  Unix and Mac
    versions also available.
    The crypto package violates RSA patents, but the bignum routines
    can be used without fear of legal repercussions.

Bell's Arbitrary Precision Calculator
    David I. Bell, Australia  (dbell@pdact.pd.necisa.oz.au)

    Arbitrary-precision calculator with good online help, C-like
    language, many builtin functions, support for integers,
    rational numbers (they work like floating point), complex numbers,
    matrices, strings, lists, files, "objects".  Includes

Built-in support in other languages
    Various

    Multiple precision arithmetic is available in a number of 
    programming languages, such as Lisp and ABC (cf. mcsun.eu.net).
    Perl (by Larry Wall, available from devvax.jpl.nasa.gov)
    includes source, in Perl, for such a package, but it's probably
    not suitable for serious use.
    For some of these, source code may be available.  This list is
    long enough, so I'm not going to pursue it aggressively.

If you've got a secure device, you don't need public keys.

If the secret key which all chips share is SK, you can just use KP = 
E{(myname, yourname, date) ; SK}.

Maybe that's why Jim Bidzos was reported as being cheesed off.

I seriously doubt that any practical implementation of this proposal would
place the onus on the individual to register keys.  Realistically, the
Clipper-Chip will probably emit an ID code which will serve as the identifier
when requesting the key fragments.  The chip manufacturer would register
this identifier code vs. key combination when the chip is made and the
(uninitiated) end-user can therefore remain completely outside the loop.
The chip could be used in a cellular phone, a modem, or other device --
it really makes no difference:  When the authorities detect the use of this
encryption standard during surveillance, they would then capture the ID
and apply for the key in order to decrypt the data.

Please note that Bill Clinton probably has little if anything to do

any "moves" being made using this chip as a pawn.

Remember, when you elect a president of the united states, it's not
the case that all the Republicans, etc. in the NSA and FBI and CIA
immediately pack their bags and get replaced by a team of fresh young
Democrats.  Most of the government -- say, 96% -- is appointed or
hired rather than elected.  Since this Clipper device has been in
production for over six months, it probably has little or no 
foundation in the currently elected Democratic Executive body.

        This sounds like a version Unix. Solaris?



Secrecy in Clipper Chip

The serial number of the clipper chip is encrypted with the system key and
transmitted as one part of a three part message.

Presumably the protocol can be recovered (if by nothing else, differential
analysis).

Postulate if you will, a chip (or logic) sitting between the clipper chip
and its communications channel.  The purpose of this chip is twofold:
    
	1) Transmit Channel

	    The spoof chip XORs the 30 bit encrypted serial number with
	    a secondary keying variable.  This renders the serial number
	    unrecoverable with just the system key

	2) Recieve Channel

	    The spoof chip XORs the incoming encrypted serial number
	    with a secondary keying variable (assuming the serial number
	    is necessary for local operation).

This has the net result of hiding the serial number.  This gets more
interesting when the number of serial numbers issued becomes large,
making it difficult to distinguish between valid serial numbers and
a spoofed serial number.  Without knowing the system key, you could
lie about the serial number, but risk detection of the lie.

IF you had the system key and the encryption algorithm you could
successfully lie with a lower probability of detection by emulating the
format of your own serial number.

Makes you wonder whats being hidden here?   Seems  like the secrecy is
to prevent you from lying about who you are.


What are the typical sizes for keys for commercial secret key algorithms?
I know DES is 56 bits ("tripple DES" is 112 bits) and IDEA is 128 bits.  Is
there anything made in the US that has 128 bit keys?  Anything anywhere
that has larger keys?  I've heard that RC2 can be scaled to arbitrarily
large keys, but is this actually implemented anywhere?

Finally, can anyone even concieve of a time/place where 128 bit keys aren't
sufficient?  (I certainly can't - even at a trillion keys a second, it
would take about 10 billion years to search just one billionth of that keys
space.)

Thanks,
Dane

I agree.  So why is Cylink the only (and expensive) game in town?

Note: I think Cylink is great, and if my boss would double my salary, I'd buy 
a bunch of their stuff :).

One thing that Clipper offers is interoperability, at a higher degree of 
security than we currently have in non-proprietary voice encryption systems.
This means it will be cheaper than anyone's proprietary scheme, and easier to 
deploy.  This is, of course, either a bug or a feature depending on how you 
look at it :).

Great!  Where can I buy it?

Another note: If "Clipper" increases the incentive to bring stronger 
encryption to the mass market, all the better.  It's far overpriced at 
the moment.

I don't care where we *need* to get it from, I care where we *can* get it

You can build them right now as long as you don't want to export (a 
restriction I firmly oppose).  The only thing stopping people from making 
cheap encryption is greed: they want a lock on the market.

Oh, come on.  Only if you trust it farther than it deserves.  A Clipper phone 
*IS NOT* a substitute for a Cylink phone, or a STU-III.  It's a substitute 
for the "voice scramblers" advertised in the back of Radio Electronics.

If Clipper comes to cellular phones along with legal proscriptions against
using other cipher systems on these phones, a new and potentially dangerous
class of crime is created.

Criminals who very badly want inscrutable tactical communications (specifically
the terrorists and drug dealers who proponents of key escrow cite as threats)
will be highly motivated to steal the cipher phone of a legitimate user, and
to kill this person or hold them hostage so discovery of compromise of the
device will be delayed.

Once a suitable collection of devices is stolen, criminals can communicate
with impunity (assuming the cipher system carries no trapdoors apart from
key escrow) until and unless the compromise is discovered by some other means.

Because life-is-cheap criminals are currently willing to kill people to steal
very large and conspicuous property (luxury cars), it is reasonable to assume
that they will be willing to kill people to steal small and inconspicuous
property (a cipher cellular phone).  Just as we have seen in the past with
"blue box" technology, and in the present with modified cellular phones,
we can expect to see among high-stakes criminals a lucrative market for
stolen cipher phones which can be used for a few days.  The high-stakes
criminals will pay the life-is-cheap types substantial amounts for stolen
instruments.

Because a person is typically discovered as missing or dead in a few days,
a stolen instrument will be usable for only a few days.  There will be a
continuing demand for fresh phones: fresh bodies.

In other words, Clipper and similar systems have the potential to turn a
current inconvenience to law enforcement into a direct, vicious, and
persistent threat to the general public.

On the other hand, if a criminal were to apply some arbitrary cipher to a
device in a mostly non-ciphered network, the communication will at least
stand out as being unusual, and perhaps worthy of other means of investigation.

Finally, because there is essentially no possibility of intercepting in
realtime the scrutable content of communications between stolen instruments,
there will exist strong motivation to record and archive _all_ communications
in the network for ex-post-facto scrutiny (once some criminal act is discovered,
and the instruments involved have been identified).  While recording and
archiving may not be feasible for wireline networks, it is probably feasible
across the more limited bandwidth of radio networks.  The existence of these
recordings could open up vast potential for abuse.

Actually, old video games and pinball machines are supposed to work pretty

They key depositories are IRRELEVANT. In order for the applicable law
enformcement agencies to be able to know what keys to request from
escrow, the system will have to squawk its serial number in clear text
as part of the link establishment protocol. Whoever owns the program 
that assigns keys to each serial number won't need access to the key
depository.

In other words, the FBI may need a court-ordered release of escrowed
keys, but the NSA has the keys before the chip is ever manufactured.
There is no need to go through the escrow or to try all keys. While
relations between law enforment agencies have sometimes been strained,
there is also a long history of trading favors. This will re-establish
the NSA as a very important agency for everyone to get along with,
because they can give you untraceable encryption leaks without court
orders.

The more I think about this affair, the fouler it smells. I'd rather
have a DES with an engineered-in backdoor ...

Sure.  The two don't interoperate.  You couldn't talk to, say, a Cylink phone 
from a Clipper phone.  I would expect even multiprotocal phones to come with 
indicators saying which kind of link encryption is in use...

    Notwithstanding all the legitimate fuss about this proposal, how much
of a change is it?  ATT's last product in this area (a) was priced over
$1000, as I suspect 'clipper' phones will be; (b) came to the customer 
with the key automatically preregistered with government authorities. Thus,
aside from attempting to further legitimize and solidify the fed's posture,
Clipper seems to be "more of the same", rather than a new direction.
   Yes, technology will eventually drive the cost down and thereby promote
more widespread use- but at present, the man on the street is not going
to purchase a $1000 crypto telephone, especially when the guy on the other
end probably doesn't have one anyway.  Am I missing something?
   The real question is what the gov will do in a year or two when air-
tight voice privacy on a phone line is as close as your nearest pc.  That
has got to a problematic scenario for them, even if the extent of usage
never surpasses the 'underground' stature of PGP.

  But, if you are making custom equipment in any case, why not just
roll your own Clipper implementation and report the wrong keys to the
Escrow agency?  (Tells us who is going to be in the chip business if
this thing goes through--NSA, and those with something to hide from
NSA.)

  If anyone can verify that your phone is not using the key registered
to that serial number, either:

  1) They have a court ordered wiretap.  But what are they going to
do?  Tell the judge that this individual really does have privacy?
All they know is that the keys are not enough, but not why.

  2) They have a court ordered wiretap on a phone in this series.
(This part is really scary.  Since the "expectation" is that all
chips in a particular batch will uses seeds based on the same S1 and
S2 and the serial number, getting the keys for one of a batch may give
access to all.)

  3) There is a backdoor which allows all messages to be deciphered
without the keys.  I find this one especially threatening since the
scheme seems very open to known plaintext attacks.  (What I need to
decipher is the data in the header.  If I talk to someone who has one
of these phones, presumably there will be an automatically negotiated
key generated.  I'm not trying to decipher the record of the
conversation to know what was said, I use it as a known plaintext to
recover the backdoor represented by the header, but I know what the
header says for conversations I participate in.  Even worse, if the
phones in a series have related keys, I can buy a phone/chip from the
same production lot.  Then I can recover its keys, either elegantly by
talking to myself, or by brute force analysis of the actual chip, then
apply the key generation process with those seeds to find the target
keys.)

    Hmmm!  I don't think I want to ever come close to these phones.
Even DES is starting to look good.  Two cans and a string will provide
much better security.

Perhaps the critical element is the driver circuitry?  The cabling?

Thousands?  Tens of thousands?  Do some arithmetic, please...  Skipjack
has 2^80 possible keys.  Let's assume a brute-force engine like that
hypothesized for DES:  1 microsecond per trial, 1 million chips.  That's
10^12 trials per second, or about 38,000 years for 2^80 trials.  Well,
maybe they can get chips running at one trial per nanosecond, and build
a machine with 10 million chips.  Sure -- only 3.8 years for each solution.

IDEA uses 128-bit keys.  Shall I bother doing the calculations for you?
Hint:  multiply 3.8 years by 2^(128-80).  And you can't do IDEA at that
speed; key setup takes much too long.  I wouldn't be surprised if that
were the case for Skipjack, too, though there's no way of knowing just
yet.  DES used only xor because that's what was feasible with mid-70's
technology.  Modern chips can do a lot more.

NSA may or may not know how to crack Skipjack and IDEA (I doubt it for
the former; I have no idea for the latter, though it does seem to be a
strong cryptosystem).  But it ain't gonna be by exhaustive search.

Why doing it in such a rough manner? It is much more professional to
steal the chip from the phone and even to replace it with a
pin-compatible do-nothing chip that does not encrypt at all. Chances
are that the victim will not notice anything, especially if it is done
professionally.

No, because the Feds will still be able to decrypt the conversations.
True, they'll blame the wrong guys, but nevertheless one cannot say
something like "The drugs arrive tommorrow on the ship 'Terminus'"
when the Feds are listening, even if they cannot identify who the
speaker is.

No, the criminals will just use some secure encryption. The new
proposal does not stop criminals; it ensures that the government will
be able to wiretap the average citizen and stops the casual snooper.
To me, it also clearly looks as a step towards outlawing any other
strong encryption devices.

Well, I'm not a lawyer, but from what I can tell this is completely
and utterly untrue.

You see, this country has this thing called a "constitution".

If you legitimately aquire the device, and you yourself are
not a government employee or otherwise encumbered, I don't think they
can stop you from revealing anything about the device you can
determine. Remember the Pentagon Papers precedent? The First Amendment
applies here.

The U.S. does NOT have an official secrets act. We do have laws that
will punish you for revealing what classified information you learned
in your capacity as a government official, contractor, etc, and we
have laws that prohibit stealing such information. However, if they
sell you the chip, I can't see that they can make reverse engineering
it and revealing the details illegal.

	The majority of the discussion involving this "Clipper Chip" seems to
	pertain to the encryption of telephone conversations.  Does anyone
	know if that means this chip is designed to work primarily with analog
	signals?  The language sort of suggests this, but it's hard to say.

I'd lay a few bucks that its just data-in-data-out in parallel.  I suspect
to make it a phone you'd need a codec and speech compression.  There would
be a loss of bandwidth on the speech signal, which I suspect would scupper
any of the suggestions I've seen here about putting a different encryption
front end on it.

There's no hint of any modulation scheme in the docs.  I'm sure it's purely
a digital chip.  The back end will come later, but I'm *positive* it won't
be left to the manufacturers - they all have to be the same modulation
scheme to make it easy for the NSA to tap them.

The only other possibility is that this is intended only for ISDN phones.
(Puts a whole new spin on EFFs obsession about ISDN if true, bwahahaha! ;-) )

be ready to run with a pre-written government-slanted story on this in
the next issue.  ('Just keep us some pages spare boys, we'll give you
the copy in time for the presses')

We *must* get big names in the industry to write well argued pieces against
this proposal (can you call it that when it's a de facto announcement?) and
get them into the big magazines before too much damage is done.

It would be well worth folks archiving all the discussions from here since
the day of the announcement to keep all the arguments at our fingertips.  I
think between us we could write quite a good piece.

Now, who among us carries enough clout to guarantee publication?  Phil?
Don Parker?  Mitch Kapor?

I've got no doubts that this would probably have gone ahead if Bush

Other than that, Mrs. Lincoln, how did you like the play?


One of the candidates that has been suggested for a key registration
body is the ACLU.  I think this is poor choice.   The ACLU is
essentially a group of auditors: they audit how people's civil
liberties are administered.  Traditionally, auditors do not like to get
involved in the design or operational aspects of things, and with good
reason.

When I was a systems programmer, it always infuriated me that the
auditors would come in and tell us our implementation stunk from a
security point of view, but wouldn't tell us how to fix it.  I always
figured they just liked to critcize, without doing the work to help fix
the problem.

Then I took a stint as an auditor, and I found out the real reason.
Auditors don't like to recommend solutions, because it puts them in a
bad position if they have to criticize the implementation later.  The
auditee can say, "Well, you told us this way would be OK."  It
compromises the independence that is a necessary part of the auditor's
job.

Taking the case at hand, suppose ACLU becomes a key half registrar.
Suppose that, perhaps through some error on ACLU's part, a key half gets
away that shouldn't, and is used to deprive someone of her civil
liberties.  The ACLU gets wind of this, and wants to take it to court.
But they end up being at the same time on the side of the defendant
and of the plaintiff, which is not an easy position to be in.

There are exceptions to the complete independence of auditors: at one
place where I worked, when payroll checks were printed, they were signed
automatically by a signature drum on the bursting machine.  This drum
was kept by the auditors (who also kept the check stock), and
was brought down to Data Processing when it was time to do the checks.

I believe the difference between this situation and the key registration
situation is that it is fairly obvious when it is time to do the payroll
checks:  if they were done yesterday, and someone wants to do them again
today, he better be able to produce yesterday's checks so that they can
be destroyed.  Determining which of the many requests for key halves are
legit is a trickier process, one much more prone to mistakes that could
put the ACLU in a protecting-the-client versus protecting-the-ACLU
conflict of interest.

As always, my opinions are my own.

I'm attempting to write a serious policy paper examining whether the
proposed wiretap (or "Clipper") chip is a cost-effective tool for
police investigation.  That is, ignoring concerns about government
intrusions into individual privacy, is the value of easy wiretaps to
investigators greater than the cost to the communications industry,
and their customers, to support this wiretap technology?  

A rough estimate suggests that wiretaps are worth about five million
dollars per year to U.S. law enforcement agencies.  (In 1990, 872 U.S.
wiretaps led to 2057 arrests, while total police expenditures of $28
billion led to 11.25 million arrests [ref US Statistical Abstracts].)
I'm working on estimating this wiretap benefit more accurately, but
I'd like to ask hardware experts out there to help me with estimating
the costs of the new proposed wiretap technology.

Please send me quotable/citeable estimates for:

- How many chips which would need to be made per year to keep all
  phones with wiretap chips?
- How much would it cost to make each chip?
- How much did it cost to develop this technology in the first place?
- How much more would supporting hardware, people, etc. cost, per chip?
- What percentage cheaper would encryption chips and support have been
  if private enterprise could compete to meet customer encryption needs?
- What percentage of phone traffic would be taken up by the proposed
  "law enforcement blocks"?
- What is the total cost of handling all phone traffic per year?

Put another way, the question I'm asking is, what if each police
agency that wanted a particular wiretap had to pay for it, being
charged their share of the full social cost of forcing communication
to be wiretap compatible?  Would they choose to buy such wiretaps, or
would they find it more cost-effective to instead investigate crimes
in other ways?

Sorry if I was less than clear.  :-) I was referring to our own efforts
to receive export permission from NSA for the PKZIP encryption
algorithm, not to any effort on the part of Phil Katz or PKWare.

I should point out that the original version of this algorithm was
designed by Roger Schlafly and that WE (meaning Roger and myself) were
twice denied an export license for it.  The second go 'round was just
this past fall.

I had no knowledge of Phil's attempts in this.  I do not even *know* for
sure if he choose to implement the algorithm as it was designed by
Roger, though I *believe* that was at least the case for versions prior
to 2.0.  And then there's the question of key management.  :-)

And even if our applications were identical, there is no reason to
assume the NSA would treat them that way.  :-)

	I am an idiot. The plaintext that's relevant is the session key.
If you know that, you probably don't need a roomful of chips, do you?
If you were going to brute force something interesting, that'd be the
message stream, which is sort of approximately known by, say, a bug in
my office. Then your roomful of chips could get the session key. Which
I change every morning.

I've been a very intent NREN spectator of the NREN for years.  As a 
commercial IP software vendor, it really is my professional opinion that the 
NREN, at this point, is irrelevant to private sector networking.  If it had 
been deployed five years ago, it would have been a major development.  Now,
however, it's just an upgrade to the NSFnet, and an attempt to revive the 
lagging use of the national supercomputer centers.  You could cut out the 
NSFnet completely, and the Internet would continue chugging along without a 
hiccup (aside from a few universities).

Long-haul networking and Internet connectivity have long since ceased to be 
under federal sponsorship or regulation, at least in the USA.  The success of 
the CIX (Commercial Internet Exchange) is a prime example of this.  While our 
dear VP has been promoting his "data superhighway," the private sector has 
been building it, without the NSFnet's restrictions.

To illustrate, a connection from the machine on my desk to the machine your 
article was posted from (pizzabox.demon.co.uk) involves *only* commercial IP 
providers until it hits Amsterdam.  No NSFnet.  No NREN.  No "appropriate 
use" restrictions.  It's even 1.544mbps (T1) until it hits the EUnet 
gateway...

The only way to view this method of generating unit keys is as a back-door.
What else can you call a key deterministically generated from the serial
number?


 To generate the unit key for a serial number N, the 30-bit value N is
   first padded with a fixed 34-bit block to produce a 64-bit block N1.
   S1 and S2 are then used as keys to triple-encrypt N1, producing a
   64-bit block R1:

	   R1 = E[D[E[N1; S1]; S2]; S1] .

   Similarly, N is padded with two other 34-bit blocks to produce N2 and
   N3, and two additional 64-bit blocks R2 and R3 are computed:  

	   R2 = E[D[E[N2; S1]; S2]; S1] 
	   R3 = E[D[E[N3; S1]; S2]; S1] .

   R1, R2, and R3 are then concatenated together, giving 192 bits. The
   first 80 bits are assigned to U1 and the second 80 bits to U2.  The
   rest are discarded.  The unit key U is the XOR of U1 and U2.  U1 and U2
   are the key parts that are separately escrowed with the two escrow
   agencies.


What happens is that the need for the Escrow houses is completely eliminated.
Or should I say, the need to _access_ the Escrow houses to decrypt the data.
The houses will still serve a real purpose as far as generating the illusion
of protection, and small-town cops won't be let in on the "secret", so they
will still go through the motions of going to the Escrow houses, but the fact
is __the Federal government CAN and WILL build a chip which generates the unit
keys from the encrypted serial number!__  'Nuff Said.

I find this a very disturbing view!  Yes, we DO care about EVERYONE's
privacy... Even if "they" don't know it. What happens if the gov't
starts creating legislation such that the Clipper and such
technologies become the only "legal" encryption forms?  What happens
when the Clipper is the *ONLY* type of encryption chips available to
the masses?

Sure, you might have your own method of encryption, but if you don't
have anyone else to talk to, what use is it?  You can't assume that
EVERYONE will be as open as you appear to be about encryption.

The point here is not the specific instance of the Wiretap Chip.
Rather, it is like having the government telling you that they want a
copy of your house key, safe-deposit box keys, etc., and telling you
that "they wont use them unless its totally neccessary."  I sure
wouldn't want that.  Why should encryption be any different?

	While I think it is unrealistic to suppose that the federal
agencies will fail to promptly comply with a court order, there is 
still a good point here.  Local law enforcement will be unable to perform
a wiretap without bringing in federal agencies.   Based on the (possibly
incomplete) understanding of the system quoted from D. Denning, only the
FBI will be able to decrypt the system key encryption layer, which seems
to be needed even to identify what escrowed keys to request.  This moves
a great deal of law enforcement power to the federal level.
	The reason I like this point is that it may sway or even persuade
people who don't generally line up with the civil liberties crowd.  A
national police force is opposed by people from a broad range of political 
viewpoints.

  For that matter, it shouldn't be that difficult to design a black box
that gives off EMR similar to a monitor with gibberish on the screen....

I'm not sure it is a major limiting move... in the academic circles
I've seen, arguing for increased government intervention and
management is almost always a plus (not the least because it usually
means more high paying jobs for academics as "advisors").  Also
consider that it looks like Denning has some decent NSA / government
connections, which is always a plus for an academic institute that
wants more government funding and work tossed their way.

Despicable, yes; career limiting, well, the publicity probably
outweighs the drawbacks.  And there are a whole bunch of people who
think the whole thing is just peachy keen. If it's only going to be
used against drug dealers, child pornographers, and terrorists, well
it must be good. :p

  Assuming that the bad guys can easily obtain substitute chips which don't
cause any noticeable effect to either the user or the person at the other end
of the line (if there is any significant difficulty to obtaining such chips,
some of the criminals will decide to fall back on the murder/kidnap method).

 This assumes that the Feds are tapping Clipper phones belonging to ordinary
citizens (getting such a phone is the whole point of the crime under
discussion).  To be sure, I wouldn't put it past them -- but raising the
possibility of such crime has the benefit of forcing the Feds to either
'fess up about such intentions in advance or state that using Clipper
exposes the user to an additional criminal threat. <g>

  Agreed.

  Which is to say: is the NSA -totally- perfidious, or does it at least
have the redeeming virtue of taking care of its own? <g>

First, what the fuck is NASA doing wasting my tax dollars doing
policy papers on stuff far outside of their purvew/mission?
                                                                         
Second, this isn't a problem of economics.  This is a problem of
the incremental accumulation of police-state powers by our government.
 
How, exactly, do you put a price on the loss of freedom of a society?
Maybe use the dollars/life lost calculations for the extra people
killed by the gov.  The pain and suffering cases for those tortured.
The dollars/life lost caused by the inevitable collapse of the economy,
and all the secondary effects of diseases, diet, etc.  Plus, the
inevitable collapse of the economy as the gov controls it, becomes 
corrupt, etc.

Do us a favor.  Resign rather than right this paper for NASA.  Go
do useful work for the society.

Here are four pseudo-random character generators, based on
irreducible trinomials.  Each contains 16 separate trinomials,
one of which is selected on initialization (there are 64
distinct trinomials between the 4 PRCGs).  The PRCGs are
initialized with a 32-bit seed, and a 4-bit trinomial-
selector.

I would like to get comments on these by anyone who is
interested enough to look them over.  Please email,
because our news is on the fritz (Note that this was

It seems likely to me that that a large subset of encrypted communications
would be archived to tape so they could be read if sometime in the future
probable cause arises and a warrant is obtained.  I can even imagine this
being found legal and constitutional, since nothing is actually listened to
until a valid warrant is issued and the keys are obtained.

Imagine archiving all pay-phone conversations, so if someone turns out
to be a drug dealer, you can listen to all their past drug deals.  And
archive calls to/from suspected Mafia members, potential terrorists,
radicals, etc.  Imagine the convenience for the police of being able to
get a warrant now and listening to all the calls the World Trade Center
bombers made in the past year.

Since archiving would be such a powerful tool and so easy to do, why
wouldn't it happen?

Read this through once or twice.  Then replace "prince" with
"government" or "president", as appropriate, and read it again.  

[From Chapter XX of _The Prince_, by N. Macchiavelli, as translated by
Daniel Donno.]

	In order to keep their lands secure, some princes have
disarmed their subjects; others have prompted division within the
cities they have subjugated.  Some have nurtured animosities against
themselves; others have sought to win the approval of those they
initially distrusted.  Some have erected fortresses; others have
destroyed them.  Now, although it is impossible to set down definite
judgements on all of these measures without considering the particular
circumstances of the states where they may be employed, I shall
nevertheless discuss them in such broad terms as the subject itself
will allow.

	To begin with, there has never been a case of a new prince
disarming his subjects.  Indeed, whenever he found them disarmed, he
proceeded to arm them.  For by arming your subjects, you make their
arms your own.  Those among them who are suspicious become loyal,
while those who are already loyal remain so, and from subjects they
are transformed into partisans.  Though you cannot arm them all,
nonetheless you increase your safety among those you leave unarmed by
extending privileges to those you arm.  Your different treatment of
the two categories will make the latter feel obligated to you, while
the former will consider it proper thoat those who assume added duties
and dangers should receive advantages.  

	When you disarm your subjects, however, you offend them, by
showing that, either from cowardliness or from lack of faith, you
distrust them; and either conclusion will induce them to hate you.
Moreover, since it is impossible for you to remain unarmed, you would
have to resort to mercenaries, whose limitations have already been
discussed. Even if such troops were good, however, they could never be
good enough to defend you from powerful enemies, and doubtful
subjects.  Therefore, as I have said, a new prince in a newly acquired
state has always taken measures to arm his subjects, and history is
full of examples proving that this is so.

	But when a prince takes posession of a new state which he
annexes as an addition to his original domain, then he must disarm all
the subjects of the new state except those who helped him to acquire
it; and these, as time and occasion permit, he must seek to render
soft and weak.  He must arrange matters in such a way that the arms of
the entire state will be in the hands of soldiers who are native to
his original domain.

	...

	And since the subject demands it, I will not fail to remind
any prince who has acquired a new state by the aid of its inhabitants
that he soundly consider what induced them to assist him; if the
reason is not natural affection for him, but rather dissatisfaction
with the former government, he will find it extremely difficult to
keep them friendly, for it will be impossible to please them.  If he
will carefully think the matter through in the light of examples drawn
from ancient and modern affairs, he will understand why it is much
easier to win the favor of those who were happy with their former
government, and hence were his enemies, than to keep the favor of
those who, out of dissatisfaction with the former rule, helped him to
replace it.

   It depends on the attack.  Adding a bit to the key doubles the amount of
work to be done in a straight brute-force attack, where you try every single
possible key until one works.  Processing and storage requirements for this
kind of attack on a 128-bit key seem like they ought to make it effectively
impossible.  However, there may be other attacks whose difficulty is (for
example) proportional to, say, 2**sqrt(n), or some such.  Also, a long
key does you little good if there is a way to incrementally guess a little
of the key at a time....

(the date I have for this is 1-26-93)

note Clinton's statements about encryption in the 3rd paragraph..  I guess
this statement doesen't contradict what you said, though.

--- cut here ---

        WASHINGTON (UPI) -- The War on Drugs is about to get a fresh
start, President Clinton told delegates to the National Federation
of Police Commisioners convention in Washington.
        In the first speech on the drug issue since his innaugural,
Clinton said that his planned escalation of the Drug War ``would make
everything so far seem so half-hearted that for all practical
purposes this war is only beginning now.'' He repeatedly emphasized
his view that ``regardless of what has been tried, or who has tried
it, or how long they've been trying it, this is Day One to me.''
The audience at the convention, whose theme is ``How do we spell
fiscal relief?  F-O-R-F-E-I-T-U-R-E,'' interrupted Clinton frequently
with applause.
        Clinton's program, presented in the speech, follows the
outline given in his campaign position papers: a cabinet-level Drug
Czar and ``boot camps'' for first-time youthful offenders.  He did,
however, cover in more detail his plans for improved enforcement
methods.  ``This year's crime bill will have teeth, not bare gums,''
Clinton said.  In particular, his administration will place strict
controls on data formats and protocols, and require the registration
of so-called ``cryptographic keys,'' in the hope of denying drug
dealers the ability to communicate in secret.  Clinton said the
approach could be used for crackdowns on other forms of underground
economic activity, such as ``the deficit-causing tax evaders who
live in luxury at the expense of our grandchildren.''
        Clinton expressed optimism that the drug war can be won
``because even though not everyone voted for Bill Clinton last
November, everyone did vote for a candidate who shares my sense of
urgency about fighting the drug menace.  The advocates of
legalization -- the advocates of surrender -- may be very good at
making noise,'' Clinton said.  ``But when the American people cast
their ballots, it only proved what I knew all along -- that the
advocates of surrender are nothing more than a microscopic fringe.''

This only makes sense if the government prohibits alternative non-escrowed
encryption schemes. Otherwise, why not just use the front end without
clipper?

I'd lost the White House's deathless prose when I posted (that's what happens
when you read news at home when you're rat-arsed), but I did have a bunch
of follow-ups going on about cellular/cordless comms.  The original article
has reappeared, so:

    The President today announced a new initiative that will bring
    the Federal Government together with industry in a voluntary
    program to improve the security and privacy of telephone
    communications while meeting the legitimate needs of law
    enforcement.

Hmm, telephone communications could indeed include end-to-end encryption on
ordinary landlines.

    The initiative will involve the creation of new products to
    accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure
    telecommunications networks and wireless communications links.

But the next paragraph says telecoms networks and wireless communications
links.

OK, it's far from clear exactly what Cripple (what an apposite anagram) will
be applied to, but the reason Joe Public wants secure comms is to stop
people listening in to his cellular or cordless phones (and he wouldn't
even be bothered about that were it not for Wingnut and Squidqy's
misfortunes).

Yes, Cripple *might* be for end-to-end encyption, dropping to clear
when the other end doesn't have Cripple.  But then a cordless-to-ordinary
conversation would be in clear leaving the cordless end just as vulnerable
as at present.  Nope, I suspect that Cripple will only be used on radio
links.

OK, it's possible `telecommunications networks' could mean `ordinary phone
lines', but I'm betting it means the microwave links used by the telcos.

My apologies if I'm wrong, particularly if the turgid Press Release makes it
clear that I'm wrong and I missed it, but as far as I can see it was full of
obfuscation, and anyone expecting end-to-end encryption is in for a surprise
(IMHO).


BTW, Graham, I've posted questions to alt.security.pgp and not seen any
replies/followups from outside Europe - how about you?  Have I made it into
everyone's kill file, or is there some problem?

Read it again yourself, then re-apply the admonition you gave to the
previous poster to yourself, as well.  The first clause is not a condition,
it is a reason for explicitly supporting the right WHICH EXISTS, MILITIA
OR NOT, that the people have a right to keep and bear arms.  This is
NOT a right granted by the Constitution, it is a right presumed to exist
by default.  The Constitution mentioning a right is to prevent the
government from removing that right by stating very clearly the government
shall NOT infringe (mess with, block, limit) that right.  Remember the
Constitution is a bunch of negative things - things the government CANNOT
do.  All rights, etc not epxressly given to the government go to the
states and the PEOPLE (the same people the other 9 Amendments in the
Bill of Rights talk about).

Since I am sure you will summarily reject my interpretation, I am
appending a linguistic analysis by one far more expert than myself (and
you, I suspect).  I am sure you will find his qualifications adequate.
If that isn't enough I can send you the Senate Subcommitee to the
Judiciary on the Constitution report on the same thing...  There are
some things in there that Big Brother types, like Biden, etc must have
really had to swallow hard to admit.

I think you will find that people that seriously study the Constitution
and state what it means will say the same thing.  Those who come up
with 'new improved meanings' are those who are trying to subvert the
Constitution for a given agenda.  Like Clinton and his Clinton Cripple,
Gun Control, People Control, and Control Control, and the whole nasty
mess.

Please tell us how this person is in error, won't you? (And please back it
up with some proof, since I am backing my assertion up with independent
proof, and have a BUNCH MORE I can provide...).

			THE UNABRIDGED SECOND AMENDMENT

			      by J. Neil Schulman

If you wanted to know all about the Big Bang, you'd ring up Carl Sagan,
right ?  And if you wanted to know about desert warfare, the man to call
would be Norman Schwarzkopf, no question about it.  But who would you call
if you wanted the top expert on American usage, to tell you the meaning
of the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution ?

That was the question I asked A.C. Brocki, editorial coordinator of the Los
Angeles Unified School District and formerly senior editor at Houghton
Mifflin Publishers -- who himself had been recommended to me as the
foremost expert on English usage in the Los Angeles school system.  Mr.
Brocki told me to get in touch with Roy Copperud, a retired professor
journalism at the University of Southern California and the author of
"American Usage and Style: The Consensus."

A little research lent support to Brocki's opinion of Professor Copperud's
expertise.

Roy Copperud was a newspaper writer on major dailies for over three decades
before embarking on a a distinguished 17-year career teaching journalism at
USC.  Since 1952, Copperud has been writing a column dealing with the
professional aspects of journalism for "Editor and Publisher", a weekly
magazine focusing on the journalism field.

He's on the usage panel of the American Heritage Dictionary, and Merriam
Webster's Usage Dictionary frequently cites him as an expert.  Copperud's
fifth book on usage, "American Usage and Style: The Consensus," has been in
continuous print from Van Nostrand Reinhold since 1981, and is the winner
of the Association of American Publisher's Humanities Award.

That sounds like an expert to me.

After a brief telephone call to Professor Copperud in which I introduced
myself but did not give him any indication of why I was interested, I sent
the following letter:

"I am writing you to ask you for your professional opinion as an expert in
English usage, to analyze the text of the Second Amendment to the United
States Constitution, and extract the intent from the text.

"The text of the Second Amendment is, 'A well-regulated Militia, being
necessary for the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep
and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.'

"The debate over this amendment has been whether the first part of the
sentence, 'A well-regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a
free State', is a restrictive clause or a subordinate clause, with respect
to the independent clause containing the subject of the sentence, 'the
right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.'

"I would request that your analysis of this sentence not take into
consideration issues of political impact or public policy, but be restricted
entirely to a linguistic analysis of its meaning and intent.  Further,
since your professional analysis will likely become part of litigation
regarding the consequences of the Second Amendment, I ask that whatever
analysis you make be a professional opinion that you would be willing to
stand behind with your reputation, and even be willing to testify under
oath to support, if necessary."

My letter framed several questions about the test of the Second Amendment,
then concluded:

"I realize that I am asking you to take on a major responsibility and task
with this letter.  I am doing so because, as a citizen, I believe it is
vitally important to extract the actual meaning of the Second Amendment.
While I ask that your analysis not be affected by the political importance of
its results, I ask that you do this because of that importance."

After several more letters and phone calls, in which we discussed terms for
his doing such an analysis, but in which we never discussed either of our
opinions regarding the Second Amendment, gun control, or any other political
subject, Professor Copperud sent me the follow analysis (into which I have
inserted my questions for the sake of clarity):

[Copperud:] "The words 'A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the
security of a free state,' contrary to the interpretation cited in your
letter of July 26, 1991, constitutes a present participle, rather than a
clause.  It is used as an adjective, modifying 'militia,' which is
followed by the main clause of the sentence (subject 'the right', verb
'shall').  The to keep and bear arms is asserted as an essential for
maintaining a militia.

"In reply to your numbered questions:

[Schulman:] "(1) Can the sentence be interpreted to grant the right to keep
and bear arms solely to 'a well-regulated militia'?"

[Copperud:] "(1) The sentence does not restrict the right to keep and bear
arms, nor does it state or imply possession of the right elsewhere or by
others than the people; it simply makes a positive statement with respect
to a right of the people."

[Schulman:] "(2) Is 'the right of the people to keep and bear arms' granted
by the words of the Second Amendment, or does the Second Amendment assume a
preexisting right of the people to keep and bear arms, and merely state
that such right 'shall not be infringed'?"

[Copperud:] "(2) The right is not granted by the amendment; its existence
is assumed.  The thrust of the sentence is that the right shall be
preserved inviolate for the sake of ensuring a militia."

[Schulman:] "(3) Is the right of the people to keep and bear arms
conditioned upon whether or not a well regulated militia, is, in fact
necessary to the security of a free State, and if that condition is not
existing, is the statement 'the right of the people to keep and bear Arms,
shall not be infringed' null and void?"

[Copperud:] "(3) No such condition is expressed or implied.  The right to
keep and bear arms is not said by the amendment to depend on the existence
of a militia.  No condition is stated or implied as to the relation of the
right to keep and bear arms and to the necessity of a well-regulated
militia as a requisite to the security of a free state.  The right to keep
and bear arms is deemed unconditional by the entire sentence."

[Schulman:] "(4) Does the clause 'A well-regulated Militia, being necessary
to the security of a free State,' grant a right to the government to place
conditions on the 'right of the people to keep and bear arms,' or is such
right deemed unconditional by the meaning of the entire sentence?"

[Copperud:] "(4) The right is assumed to exist and to be unconditional, as
previously stated.  It is invoked here specifically for the sake of the
militia."

[Schulman:] "(5) Which of the following does the phrase 'well-regulated
militia' mean: 'well-equipped', 'well-organized,' 'well-drilled,'
'well-educated,' or 'subject to regulations of a superior authority'?"

[Copperud:] "(5) The phrase means 'subject to regulations of a superior
authority;' this accords with the desire of the writers for civilian
control over the military."

[Schulman:] "(6) (If at all possible, I would ask you to take account the
changed meanings of words, or usage, since that sentence was written 200
years ago, but not take into account historical interpretations of the
intents of the authors, unless those issues can be clearly separated."

[Copperud:] "To the best of my knowledge, there has been no change in the
meaning of words or in usage that would affect the meaning of the
amendment.  If it were written today, it might be put: "Since a
well-regulated militia is necessary tot he security of a free state, the
right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be abridged.'

[Schulman:] "As a 'scientific control' on this analysis, I would also
appreciate it if you could compare your analysis of the text of the Second
Amendment to the following sentence,

"A well-schooled electorate, being necessary to the security of a free
State, the right of the people to keep and read Books, shall not be
infringed.'

"My questions for the usage analysis of this sentence would be,

"(1) Is the grammatical structure and usage of this sentence and the way
the words modify each other, identical to the Second Amendment's sentence?;
and

"(2) Could this sentence be interpreted to restrict 'the right of the people
to keep and read Books' _only_ to 'a well-educated electorate' -- for
example, registered voters with a high-school diploma?"

[Copperud:] "(1) Your 'scientific control' sentence precisely parallels the
amendment in grammatical structure.

"(2) There is nothing in your sentence that either indicates or implies the
possibility of a restricted interpretation."

Professor Copperud had only one additional comment, which he placed in his
cover letter: "With well-known human curiosity, I made some speculative
efforts to decide how the material might be used, but was unable to reach
any conclusion."

So now we have been told by one of the top experts on American usage what
many knew all along: the Constitution of the United States unconditionally
protects the people's right to keep and bear arms, forbidding all
governments formed under the Constitution from abridging that right.

As I write this, the attempted coup against constitutional government in the
Soviet Union has failed, apparently because the will of the people in that
part of the world to be free from capricious tyranny is stronger than the
old guard's desire to maintain a monopoly on dictatorial power.

And here in the United States, elected lawmakers, judges, and appointed
officials who are pledged to defend the Constitution of the United States
ignore, marginalize, or prevaricate about the Second Amendment routinely.
American citizens are put in American prisons for carrying arms, owning
arms of forbidden sorts, or failing to satisfy bureaucratic requirements
regarding the owning and carrying of firearms -- all of which is an
abridgement of the unconditional right of the people to keep and bear arms,
guaranteed by the Constitution.

And even the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), staunch defender of the
rest of the Bill of Rights, stands by and does nothing.

it seems it is up to those who believe in the right to keep and bear arms to
preserve that right.  no one else will.  No one else can.  Will we beg our
elected representatives not to take away our rights, and continue regarding
them as representing us if they do?  Will we continue obeying judges who
decide that the Second Amendment doesn't mean what it says it means but
means whatever they say it means in their Orwellian doublespeak ?

Or will be simply keep and bear the arms of our choice, as the Constitution
of the United States promises us we can, and pledge that we will defend
that promise with our lives, our fortuned, and our sacred honor ?

I think your experiences under the Bulgarian regime are highly relevant.
We have too many people with their heads in the sand saying it cannot
happen here, as our Constitutional Rights are being trashed every day
because the government justifies doing some end-run around the protections
by a 'crisis' requiring 'drastic action'.   It is most likely that in the
future possession of secure encryption tools will be regarded as possession
of 'terrorist and drug dealers tools', and be some serious Fedaral Felony.
Just like common tools are 'burgular tools' if the police say so, common
computer programs (even computers themselves) are now 'hackers tools',
and will become 'terrorist tools'.  BET ON IT.

The insights of someone who has lived throught this are very important.
If the US goes the way of the old Soviet Union and its client states
as far as individual rights, privacy and overall freedom are concerned,
the rest of the world (remember 'New World Order'?) will not be far
behind - only a few years.

Please keep posting anything you find that is deficient or that threatens
ones rights in this thing.

For example, a conversation between a suspect and a lawyer will no longer
be private from Big Brother eavesdropping.  Political dissent allready
is very dangerous in this country, all it takes is the government to
decide that enough people will take one seriously, then one becomes
guilty of 'plotting to overthrow the government by illegal means'.  The
phrase 'illegal means' is defined as whatever the government wants it
to be defined as.

Couple this with Clinton's pressing for a 'smart' National ID card (an
'Internal passport'?), with the added wrinkle that anything about you and
your past can be put on it, and you can only take the government's
word as to what is really on it (since they will be the only ones
with the means to completely read and reprogram the thing).  Isn't
that nice?

While the Feds can bust into one's safe without the keys, the owner
knows his safe has been broken into.  When they break into your 'secure'
phone conversations (or other stored/transmitted data in the near future)
you have no way of knowing, so accountability as to the legalities has
gone out the window.  Just like a safe, if they have a legal cause, they
can get the keys from the suspect, just like they can get the keys to
a safe or the combination from the suspect.  Same with encryption:
Record everything, get the warrants, THEN decode it with the keys
obtained from the suspect.

This Clinton Cripple, along with its natural extensions, will make any
priviliged communications between client and lawyer, and any meaningful
political dissent virtually impossible.  Which is the general idea.
Any propeganda about its being secure, and the safeguards, and all
of that are just that - propeganda to reassure people so they will
by into this monstrosity.  DON'T BE SUCKERED.

BIG BROTHER IS LISTENING!!!

Some countries have laws about importing crypto gear--I believe the U.S.
does. Without a license the above scheme won't work (at least not legally)
in such countries, including at least France and the U.S.

This won't work if there is a checksum on the keys you don't know about.
Neither will registering a clipper chip and then substituting a
"counterfeit" one if the serial number contains a checksum.

Chances are the government has thought of this, and "just anyone" won't be
permitted access to enough of the internals to make a "fake" clipper chip.
Chances are that the government has classified some details of the internals
at a very high level, and manufacturers are required to observe security
safeguards and clearances corresponding to that level.

While not perfect, it would prevent Joe Hacker from rolling his own spoofing
chip, since not many counterfeiters can survive a background investigation.
Some of the more notorious self-styled dissidents here, for example, have
already got their heads so high above the tall grass that they'd have little
chance of getting a clearance.

Of course it's not impossible that someone do this, but probably extremely
difficult. Chances are there will also be very heavy criminal penalties for
phony clipper chips, on some national security/classified info grounds or
other, thus making the game not worth the candle.

Actually the govrnment is telling you that if you want to use their
"product" the manufacturer (actually better yet, some "trusted" pair
of escrow agencies) has to have the key.

Most of us already are in this situation--our car makers have keys to our
cars (or can get them quickly from the VIN  number), and I have no doubt
that if presented with a court order, they'd surrender copies to the
government.

Chances are that many locksmiths have the code numbers for house locks
they've installed, and in an emergency can cut keys; thus they'd also
provide such keys to the government pursuant to a court order.

The state has no difficulty gaining access to your safe deposit box if they
have a court order.

Bad analogy.

This is not to argue for or against the proposal, but rather better
distinctions are required in thinking about it than "house key, safe-deposit
keys, etc.".

While I don't know the full scope of the activities of the EFF, 
from what little I've seen I think it would be better to lobby for 
strong cryptography through a distinct organization.

The EFF has been associated with efforts to prevent the banning of sex
and pictures newsgroups at various universities. Horror stories about the
contents of those groups (e.g. exploitative pictures of possibly underaged
models) have already surfaced in the press. The White House bulletin
already raised the specter of drug-dealing and terrorism, which is only one
step removed from the old "crypto-wielding child molester" argument.  An
EFF lobbying effort for cryptography would be too easily derailed by the
connection to child pornography and the like.

Similarly, LPF is connected with Stallman and his Gnu project.  In
light of, say, the Gnu Manifesto, this means that in a public debate it
stands to be labelled as "communist", "anarchist hackers", radical, etc.  

I don't know about CPSR, but if it is an offshoot of Physicians for Social
Responsibility (best known for Helen Caldicott and her hysterical
antinuclear lobbying) then it probably also carries unwelcome political
baggage.

Perhaps for practical reasons a lobbying organization for cryptography
would best be formed under the umbrella of EFF or some other existing
group, but its charter should then be distinct, independent, and limited to
advocacy for the right to cryptography.  To reiterate Dan Bernstein's
question: does any suitable organization exist?  If not, what are you going
to do about it?

Having mentioned the possible dangers of unwelcome political associations,
I would be remiss not to suggest something in the opposite direction:
gathering the support of the NRA by emphasizing the RKBA side of the
issue as well as the First-Amendment side.

Whats the difference between a V.32bis modem and a V.32bis modem?

I'm not being entirely silly here: what I'm pointing out is that the

just fine to transmit scrambled vocoded voice.

  OK, Doug is right, it would be obstruction of justice, blah blah blah,
BUT, saying "I forgot" is a lie, which is just as bad from a moral point
of view _IF_ you think "lawfulness" is a good in and of itself (which 
admittedly most people do not.)  But there's an even better way out of this.
PROVIDED the government is prosecuting you criminally, you can probably
plead the fifth amendmeent and thus LEGALLY avoid revealing your key.  The
government cannot demand information from a criminal defendant which "may
tend to incriminate" that defendant.  Though this has never been applied
in the cryptography context (at least as far as I can tell) it seems an
obvious application to me.  

 This may be a common suggestion in this group, but if it's not (I'm new
here) I'd love to hear what people have to say about it.  Since I don't
really read this group (and since the subject matter is more legal than
cryptoid) maybe misc.legal.computing would be an appropriate place?

The people on usenet are clearly a special bunch.  We live the net, which
is the future of our culture.  Usenetters have rapid electronic access to
information.  Society in general must depend on CNN.  

I can only hope we can make this information accessable by the public before
the radical fringe, which _is_ the majority, destroys the fabric of
this country.  Freedom is never easily won.

 OK, I should have read the thread before posting my own $0.02.  I would
just add to Phil's very infomative discussion the following caveat: the
fifth amendment applies ONLY in crinial cases.  ("...nor shall any person .
. . be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself...").
Thus if the father sued for custody of the children, the case would be
civil and the defendant mother would not have fifth amendment protection.
Oddly enough, her refusal to give information in a civil case can lead to
criminal contempt charges (thus landing her in jail.)  The interesting part
of all this is that in a murder trial, the woman CAN plead the fifth as 
to the location of the child--this is routine.  A "computer crime" 
prosecution thus would seem to be fertile ground for this kind of defense, 
where a suit by a party injured by "hackers" would not.  If I am accused, 
for example, of sending encrypted kiddie porn over the nets the fifth should 
protect my key.  If I am accused of sending copyrighted material, however,
it proabably will not (copyright infringement not being a "crime" in the
technical sense.)  The REALLY tricky question is, say I do both (naughty
boy that I am) can the government use the information gained in the civil
trial (ie. my key) to gain access to my files for use in the criminal
prosecution.  The answer should certainly be no, but lord only knows how
this would work out.

decision that prevented the removal of "anti-American, anti-Christian,

Whew!  Take it easy on the guy.  Maybe he's going to do this in his

What is the status of cruptology for private citizens throughout the
world? or, more clearly, is there a listing of countries and their
policies on citizens encrypting electronic data?  

I'm curious how the Europeans handle this, for instance.

It means that the EFF's public stance is complicated with issues irrelevant
to the encryption issue per se. There may well be people who care about
the encryption issue who don't care to associate themselves with the
network erotica issue (or may even disagree with the EFF's position).

Ending up with pallets of baggage to drag around is a frequent 
problem with permanent organizations. EFF is no exception.

I would also like to obtain a program which will password protect

Normally I'd be the last to argue with Steve . . . but shouldn't that

machine that does 1 trial/nanosecond, we can imagine the storage medium

I perhaps should have been clearer and more concise in my post, but that's
what I get from posting at 1 am...

The central point I made is that local/state police agencies attempting to
play by the rules and get warrants, legit escrowed keys, etc., may find
themselves at the mercy of bureaucratic inertia and agency infighting
at the federal level.  

I disagree that this would assist civil liberties by hobbling the cowboy
cops.  It would be a strong incentive, as Vesselin points out, for more
police agencies to "go rogue" and try to get keys through more efficient
(but less Constitutional) means.  Notice what the release said:

   Q:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on
        a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation
        encrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to
        decipher the message?

   A:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a
                                                       ^^^^^^^^^^
        court order, to do the wiretap in the first place.
        ^^^^^^^^^^^

The clear implication is that there are "legal" authorizations other
than a court order.  Just how leaky are these?  (And who 
knows what's in those 7 pages that authorized the NSA?).  There
may well arise a black market of sorts _within_ police agencies, in which
keys are traded.  Furthermore, the police will be in an excellent
position to carry out this kind of thing without being caught.  They
already have a communication infrastructure with secure portions.  There
are a few laws that I know of, that limit citizens' rights to access
police communications (or use the information they get).  It may be
very difficult to prove police misuse -- the fact that you have such
evidence may itself be evidence that YOU have broken some other law.

Throw in private detectives, who have even fewer policy/constitutional
restrictions.  Also consider mercenaries who've "retired" from intelligence
agencies.  William Gibson must be loving it.  Great story material.

Don't think it'll happen?  

Well, consider e.g. the Michigan State Police, generally a very professional
organization, which for years kept "Red Files" on thousands of suspected 
commies, knowing full well it was not consititutional.  The standards
of evidence were just about zero: people were in the file because they
happened to park near a place where, say, a US-China People's Friendship
rally was happening -- the police went around writing down license
plate numbers.  If you happened to be visiting a friend who lived near the 
meeting place, well, the state police wound up filing you as a subversive.
(They were eventually found out and a court ruled against carrying on any
more such nonsense.  I believe thay may have had to destroy the tapes
as well.)

Even with well-meaning cops (and I'm sure there are many), there will 
be strong pressure to bend the constitutional safeguards.  We don't need
to assume corrupt or unbalanced officers -- it will all be in the interest 
of enforcing sensible laws, saving lives, and protecting property.  
Compromises will be made by well-meaning officers, facing what (to them) 
will be a moral dilemma.

Clipper will make criminals out of cops.  Do we want to do this to our
police forces?

Once the chips are released (in phones, or whatever), they are vulnerable to 
phsyical inspection and observation.  Now, I will grant that there will no 
doubt be safeguards against "peeling" the chip, but the NSA has no monopoly 
on cleverness.  The chip, and the algorithms it uses, will not remain secret 
for very long.  Any university with a VLSI lab has the required equipment, as 
does any offshore semiconductor manufacturer.

No, he gives the keys to the FBI (who may then give them to the local police
on request) who then simply put some alagator clips on your phone junction
box and conduct an illegal tap. They then decrypt when they recover the tape.
Its just doing what the government does best: breaking the law.

grady@netcom.com suggests using a common but restricted-distribution private
key to allow public key system encrypted postings. In theory that will work
fine as long as the privae key remains secure.

In practice it would be a good idea to check to see if that would be a
violation of some net rule, practice, custom, etc. I don't say it would be,
just that it would be a good idea to check. This is not like rot13 where
everybody can have the key trivially.

It would also be a good idea to check to see if such posts would be
forwarded by the sites needed to make the chain work.

Of course there'd be no problem with a discussion group travelling over
facilities entirely under the control of the members. Probably there would
also be no problem with a mailing list approach. It might even  be fun for
some.

Absolutely, if I were assured by someone I trusted that the black box was
more secure. I have nothing to conceal from the government, but I would like
to be sure that any Russian, Japanese, French, or other competitors for my
services can't read my traffic. I'd like to be sure that competitive bid
information was safe from commercial competitors and foreign governments
which would aid them.

I believe the NSA has identical motivations with respect to my activities.
The President and many other senior government officials have made it very
clear that they share these motivations. Thus I'd trust them on the
"coincidence of interests" argument as well as on a basic trust in their
professionalism and a high confidence in their skills.

   Hmmmm.  I think, with really large keyspaces like this, you need to
alter the strategy discussed for DES.  Attempt decryption of several
blocks, and check the disctribution of the contents.  I don't think it's
at all feasible to keep 2**80 encryptions of a known plaintext block on
*any* amount of tape or CD-ROM.  And certainly not 2**128 such encrypted
blocks.  (Anyone know a cheap way of converting every atom in the solar
system into a one bit storage device?)
 
   Actually, a keysearch of this kind shouldn't be much worse than the
simpler kind in terms of speed.  It's just that you have to do it over
for *every* encrypted message.
 
   Dumb question:  Has anyone ever done any serious research on how many
legitimate ASCII-encoded 8-byte blocks there are that could be part of
an english sentence?  For attacking DES in ECB mode, it seems like a
dictionary of this kind might be pretty valuable....

er, excuse me but since the escrow agencies aren't yet chosen, how can you
say they have a "history of untrustworthy behavoir[sic]"?

I'm sure each of us can think of agencies without such a history. Price
Waterhouse has kept the secret of the Academy Awards for many years, even in
the face of an aggressive press. The Federal Reserve Open Market Committee
has successfully kept decisions from leaking for the statutory period until
publication. Even the Department of Agriculture has successfully kept crop
forecasts from leaking prematurely.

Frankly, I'd trust the above (not the D of A, of course since they might be
subject to political pressure) far sooner than the ACLU, EFF, or CPSR which,
though not exactly government apologists, have no particular track record
for internal security that I know of.

I don't claim to be a crypto analyist... there isn't a whole lot of good
literature on the subject, and the best people don't seem to publish
their work :)  but I rather doubt the approach such folks use is brute
force (sorry to have implied that in my previous post).  The history
of these things is folks find clever ways of limiting the search and
bang from there.

I guess my real problem with Skipjack is I can not believe NSA would
make publicly available a system they couldn't break if they wanted...
it just isn't in their charter.  Remember DES came from IBM, not NSA
and, when first published, was given a useful life of 20 years... I think
we are well past that point now :(

Remember, based on the size of the NSA budget, they spend a lot more
on the technology of decryption than most computer companies spend on
R&D.  I have to imagine their stuff is real interesting...

A friend who once worked for them (he is dead now) said he always enjoyed
monitoring SAC's (Strategic Air Command) crypto traffic :)  and I rather
suspect that stuff is a bit more complex than Skipjack  (Or was it the
military got the stuff from the NSA just like we get Skipjack from them ;)
[BTW, folks, NSA wasn't being given the keys.  And the Walker spy case
shows for some of the systems, the KGB didn't need them either.]

I may be an anarchist nutcase, but I wouldn't have frothed overmuch
had the government proposed a secure encryption standard.  In fact,
if the NSA had come up with a privacy chip rather than a wiretap
chip, I would have been happy.  They *could* have done this -- set
up an ANSI committee, picked a secure cryptosystem, defined a
protocol and interface, and said, "Hey, start building them."

Instead we have a deliberately brain-dead version of a cryptosystem
that has not even been peer reviewed.  Yes, the NSA owns some smart
people.  But if they pulled a FEAL, well, AT&T is going to be left
with a lot of dud phones on its hands.

Heh heh.  The government already gave it up for us.  Remember in the
announcement they described this scheme as balancing the two
extremes of having no privacy and claiming that citizens had a
Constitutional right to encryption?  

So much for Clinton's support of the "right of privacy".

I apologize for being so dense but this sentence reads as if it
was lifted from a Luis Bunuel screenplay.  Am I missing something?
Why on earth would drug smugglers even _use_ the device then?
Obviously, they'll be using something like triple encryption DES instead.
As long as alternatives to Clipper remain legal, Clipper accomplishes
absolutely nothing, ZERO, as far as law enforcement is concerned.
The whole scheme is an absolute, total, incredible, waste of government
time and money AS LONG AS other encryption schemes that are any good 
remain legal.  In order for Clipper to work as intended all strong
cryptosystems have to be outlawed.

Good question. I also wanted to find out and I did a while ago.

In our former communist times such activity (i.e. sending crypto emails)
would be prevented sooner ot later, law or no law. But now there is no law 
against it. So we are free to use it. We now have an EC conformant law for 
protection and registration of personal files. You must remember that the 
situation in small countries is vastly different from the big ones.

Association for Cryptologic Research (IACR), in cooperation with 
the IEEE Computer Society Technical Committee on Security and Privacy, 
the Computer Science Department of the University of California, Santa 
Barbara, and Bell-Northern Research (a subsidiary of Northern Telecom), 
will be held on the campus of the University of California, Santa Barbara, 
on August 22-26, 1993. Original research papers and technical expository talks 
are solicited on all practical and theoretical aspects of cryptology. It is 
anticipated that some talks may also be presented by special invitation of the 
Program Committee.
-------------------------        
INSTRUCTIONS FOR AUTHORS:  Authors are requested to send 12 copies of a 
detailed abstract (not a full paper) by April 26, 1993, to the Program Chair 
at the address given below. A limit of 10 pages of 12pt type (not counting 
the bibliography or the title page) is placed on all submissions. Submissions 
must arrive on time or be postmarked no later than April 21, 1993 and sent by 
airmail in order to receive consideration by the Program Committee. It is 
required that submissions start with a succinct statement of the problem 
addressed, the solution proposed, and its significance to cryptology, 
appropriate for a non-specialist reader. Technical development directed to 
the specialist should follow as needed.
-------------------------        
Abstracts that have been submitted to other conferences that have proceedings 
are NOT eligible for submission.

Submissions MUST BE ANONYMOUS. This means that names and affiliations of 
authors should only appear on the title page of the submission; it should 
be possible to remove this page and send the papers to Program Committee 
members. A Latex style file that produces output in this format is available by email from the Program Chair.

Authors will be informed of acceptance or rejection in a letter mailed on

        CRYPTO '93  -  General Information  (August 22 - 26, 1993)
............................................................................

THE PROGRAM:  Crypto'93 is the thirteenth in a series of workshops on 
cryptology held at Santa Barbara, and is sponsored by the International 
Association for Cryptologic Research, in cooperation with the IEEE 
Computer Society Technical Committee on Security and Privacy, the Computer 
Science Department of the University of California, Santa Barbara, and 
Bell-Northern Research (a subsidiary of Northern Telecom). The program 
for the workshop will cover all aspects of cryptology. Extended abstracts of 
the papers presented at the conference will be distributed to all attendees 
at the conference, and formal proceedings will be published at a later date.

In addition to the regular program of papers selected or invited by the 
program committee, there will be a rump session on Tuesday evening for 
informal presentations. Facilities will also be provided for attendees to 
demonstrate hardware, software and other items of cryptographic interest. 
If you wish to demonstrate such items, you are urged to contact the General 
Chair so that your needs will be attended to. The social program will include 
hosted cocktail parties on Sunday and Monday. In addition, there will be a 
beach barbecue on Wednesday evening. The price of the barbecue is included 
in the room and board charge, and extra tickets may be purchased.

ABOUT THE CONFERENCE FACILITIES:  The workshop will be held on the campus of 
the University of California, Santa Barbara. The campus is located adjacent 
to the Santa Barbara airport and the Pacific Ocean. Accommodations are 
available in the university dormitories at relatively low cost for conference 
participants. Children under the age of 13 are not allowed to stay in the 
dormitories, so those bringing small children will need to make separate 
arrangements in one of several nearby hotels. More information on hotels is 
enclosed. Parking on campus is available at no cost to the participants. 
However, participants must indicate on the registration form if they desire 
a parking permit.

TRAVEL INFORMATION:  The campus is located approximately 2 miles from the 
Santa Barbara airport, which is served by several airlines, including 
American, America West, Delta, United, and US Air. Free shuttle bus service 
will be provided between the Santa Barbara airport and the campus on Sunday 
and Thursday afternoons. All major rental car agencies are also represented 
in Santa Barbara, and AMTRAK has rail connections to San Francisco from the 
north and Los Angeles from the south. Santa Barbara is approximately 100 miles 
north of Los Angeles airport, and 350 miles south of San Francisco.

REGISTRATION:  Participation is invited by interested parties, but attendance 
at the workshop is limited, and pre-registration is strongly advised. Late 
registrations, subject to a late registration fee, may be accepted if space 
is available, but there are NO GUARANTEES. To register, fill out the attached 
registration form and return to the address on the form along with payment in 
full before July 9, 1993. Campus accommodations will be available on a first 
come, first serve basis for attendees who register by July 9, 1993. The 
conference fees include participation in the program and all social functions, 
as well as membership to the IACR and a subscription to the Journal of 
Cryptology. The room and board charges include dormitory lodging and meals 
>from dinner on Sunday to lunch on Thursday. Technical sessions will run 
>from Monday morning to Thursday at noon. A very limited number of stipends 
are available to those unable to obtain funding. Applications for stipends 
should be sent to the General Chair before June 4, 1993.

For those who choose not to stay in the dormitories, the following is a 
partial list of hotels in the area. Those who choose to stay off campus are 
responsible for making their own reservations, and early reservations are 
advised since August is a popular season in Santa Barbara. Note that Goleta 
is closer to UCSB than Santa Barbara, but that a car will probably be 
required to travel between any hotel and the campus. All prices are subject 
to change; prices should be confirmed by calling the individual hotels

And since Clinton is also going full-bore to deny unconnected citizens
the means to defend themselves ("we will protect you ... 911 is good
enough for you...") by perverting or trashing the Second Amendment,
the targeted individuals will be GUARANTEED easy prey.  What is a few
bodies compared to the "greater good" of the Fed being able to defeat
a citizen's security with impunity?  You don't think there doesn't
exist a means by which the NSA can do their usual eavesdropping, scanning
for keywords, with OR WITHOUT a court order or any 'keys', do you?
If so, I got some great Florida real estate you might be interested in...

Perhaps the idea of escrowed keys is meant to divert the discussion to
how they will be safeguarded, and away from the basic fact that the
government is systematically taking away our right to privacy, to be
secure, for the means of self-defense, and just about every other right
spelled out in the Bill of Rights?

Nawwww - they are the GOVERNMENT!  "Trust us..."

<In other words, Clipper and similar systems have the potential to turn a

What is more important to the government?  Law Enforcement (people control)
or the safety of the general public?  The gun control issue should answer
that one - look at how good that works in making cities safer:  The places
that are the worst in that regard are also the places with the 'best' gun
control.  Government is NOT about public good, it is about CONTROL.

Never forget that.  Our Founding Fathers sure were concerned about it.

Absolutely.  I just meant that no secure *dedicated* crypto device has

modems that are approved either mind you - just the overpriced Couriers)

I don't know what's worse - the waste of money, or the fact that (in SPITE
of all Clinton's rhetoric to the contrary) this is a feeble attempt by
a large group of bored intelligence bureaucrats to justify their currently
useless jobs. Clinton said he was going to trim the fat from the government.
This doesn't look very dietetic to me! 

As I said before in this group: drug dealing and terrorism both tend to
be international crimes which are not going to cease if the US starts to
regulate encryption. The drug dealers and terrorists will simply go to
other countries to communicate their plans, and will still carry them out
here and/or wherever else. This is not the solution to the problem.

They try to invent a new problem by saying we "need" encryption. I guess
it's a good thing Bill Gates isn't a 4-star general or we would all "need"

This is true for the mass market, but not for those who need strong crypto
and are willing to pay the price. After all, one can buy strong crypto today
if one is willing to spend enough.

Thus the concern is not economic.

The issue most worth worrying about is that after the system takes hold, the
government will outlaw other systems, and something voluntary will become
the only system available. That is a political, not an economic issue.

As a separate matter, you may be making an implied advocacy for cheap secure
crypto for everyone. It's true that the Clipper chip would probably prevent
that except via Clipper, but "cheap, secure crypto for everyone" is a
political discussion, not an economic one, and the whole point of Clipper is 
to resolve that political (policy) tension between securing legitimate
communications and tapping the crooks.

Agreed.  Remember, I don't even think of Clipper as encryption in any real

That's not for Clinton (or anyone under him) to say, though.  Only the 
federal and supreme courts can say anything about the constitutionality.
Anything the administration or any governmental agency says is opinion at 
best.

   But there is a MUCH more pernicious problem with the scheme as
proposed.  Building a brute force machine to test 2^40 possible keys
if you have the other half from one escrow agent is EASY.  (One chip,
one test per microsecond gives you one break every two weeks, and that
break gives you all messages involving that phone.)

   The XOR scheme so that the files from one escrow agent gives you
nothing is an improvement, but notice that XORing with (truely random)
bit strings allows for an arbitrary number of escrow agents.  Using +
for XOR, SK for the escrowed key, and A and B for two random bit
strings, hand SK+A+B, SK+A, and SK+B to three escrow agents.  It is
possible to come with an encoding scheme to match any escrow pattern,
for example 3 of 4, such that fewer cooperating escrow agents gives
the cracking agency no benefit.

In most cases information you come by properly is yours to use as you wish,
but there are certainly exceptions.  If you write a paper which includes
sufficiently detailed information on how to build a nuclear weapon, it is
classified.  As I understand the law, nuclear weapons design is
_automatically_ classified even if you do the work yourself.  I believe you
are then not allowed to read your own paper.

A less serious example: if you tell drivers about a speed trap they are
about to run into, you can be fined, even though you might argue that you
broke no law when you discovered the location of the policeman.  The charge
is interfering with a police officer, which is quite similar what you would
be doing by reverse engineering the Clipper chip.

Don't tell me that you think this violates the Constitution -- find some
court cases which have struck down such laws.  Many people would not be
comforted by the fact that the government violated their rights when it
imprisoned them.

In these two sections the phrases `or other legal order' and `normally a
court order' imply there is some other way or ways of doing a legal
wiretap. What is/are these? How do they affect the way people who trust the
system of court orders to protect them feel about this escrow system?

The second section shows the sequence of events.
The law enforcer, armed with his warrant, attaches his headphones to the
line with his croc-clips (remember, these are the folk who couldn't cope
with digital telephony) and hears a load of modem-like tones (we are
talking analogue telephony here).
What next? What modulation scheme do these Clipper boxes use?
Is it possible to record the tones for use after the keys are obtained?
I thought it was quite difficult to record a modem session at some
intermediate point on the line. Maybe they have taken a crash course
in data comms and have a unit that demodulates the tones and stores the
digital stream for decryption later. This would still suffer from the
same problems as trying to record the tones as the demodulator would not
be at one end of the line. If calls can't be recorded for decryption later
it would be quite easy to foil the system by buying lots of Clipper units
(these are supposed to be cheap mass market items) and using them in turn.

How tolerant is the modulation scheme to errors? These things are proposed
for use by US corporations to secure their foreign offices, where phone
line quality may well be poor. It seems hard enough to me to get digitised
speech of any quality into something a modem can handle without having to
add lots of error correction to keep the decryption in sync.

This raises an intersting question in the UK. Here it is illegal to connect
anything to a public telecomms network without it being approved by a body
called BABT. It has been stated, either here or in the uk.telecom group,
that they will not approve equipment that does encryption. I don't know
if this is true or not, but this would make a good test case.
Perhaps `friendly' countries, and the UK may still qualify, will get
to fish in the escrowed key pool as well.

I was a cryptologic tech in the US Navy (CTRSN, nothing big).  All 'spooks'
in the Navy are required to know the "gist" of "USSID 18", the Navy-way of
naming a particular Presidential "Executive Order".  It outlines what spooks
can and can't do with respect to the privacy of US nationals.

The following information is (of course) UNCLASSIFIED.

The whole issue hangs about what you mean by "wiretap".  If the signal can
be detected by "non-intrusive" means (like radio listening), then it may be
recorded and it may be "analyzed".  "Analyzed" means that it may be either
deciphered and/or radio-location may be used to locate the transmitter.

The catch is this:  Any and all record of the signal and its derivatives
may only be kept for a maximum of 90 days, after which they are destroyed
unless permission is obtained from the US Attorney General to keep them.

   Unless there has been a _major_ change in the law, there's no such beast
   as a "classified patent."  Patents exist to encourage communications and
   develop the state of the art. 

While there aren't classified patents, there are "patent secrecy orders".

Suppose you invent a voice scrambler for CB radio, and apply for a patent.
The Patent Office decides the NSA might be interested, gives them a copy
of your application, and you get a nice note back saying your patent
application has now been classified for national security reasons and
you're no longer allowed to make and sell it.  
I'm picking this example because it happened in the late 1970s.
It was probably some analog scrambler, and would have probably
violated FCC rules anyway, but it did get classified.

Or suppose you publish a paper on your Really Spiffy Algorithm and
then file a patent application.  Since it's been published,
they can't gain anything by classifying it, though you can't get
patents in most countries other than the US, where patent laws are different.

Obviously a system of classified patents would be highly bogus
"You can't sell that widget, because there's a classified patent on it.
You're not allowed to see the patent, or know who owns the design,
so just give us all your money and work in progress and maybe we won't throw
you in jail for espionage."  Some countries might have that kind of
system :-(, but we don't have that here.  Quite.  Yet.

That doesn't worry me at all; they're not going to cheat at something
they can get caught at.  And key size is one of the things that can be
verified externally.  Feed lots of random key/input pairs into the
chip, then try flipping random key bits, and see what happens to the
output.  We already know what *should* happen -- about half the output
bits should vary, on average, from a 1-bit key change or input change.

If they were out to build a weak cryptosystem, it might be the case that
some of the bits are much less powerful than others, in the sense that
they only enter into the encryption very late in the game.  By contrast,
DES was designed to use each key bit as early as possible; the 50% output
change rate appears as early as round 5.  Again, though, I don't think
NSA is going to cheat that crudely; they're likely to get caught.

Remember that they've promised to let a committee of outside experts see
the cryptosystem design.  If you assume something DES-like, a biased
subkey generation schedule will stick out like a sore thumb.  The committee
can and should run lots of tests, and retain the output.  This can be verified
later against the chip.  And yes, the civilian community has at least some
secure storage facilities that I don't think even NSA can get into without
it being noticed, until Fort Meade gets its transporter working again.
(Oops -- I don't think I was supposed to talk about that...)  The committee
members can even retain secure copies of the code -- in two halves, which
you have to XOR together to recover the program...

Seriously, there are, I think, problems with this whole scheme.  But the
people who invented it aren't stupid, and they've been in the crypto game
and the smoke-and-mirrors game far longer than most of us.  They're not
going to lie in ways that can be detected easily, since their credibility
is the *only* thing they can use to sell this system.  If they've lied
about the civilian committee, no one will believe them about the absence
of other back doors.  If they've lied about the key size, no one will
believe that they haven't copied the programming disk with the U keys.
If they've lied about obvious aspects of the strength of the cryptosystem,
no one will believe the escrow agencies aren't in cahoots with them.

That isn't to say that they aren't lying about all those other things
anyway.  And I'm certainly not claiming that NSA can't build a cryptosystem
with a back door that the committee can't find -- look how long it took
for folks to believe that the S-boxes weren't sabotaged.  It's entirely
possible that the committee will release an ambiguous report, for just
such reasons.  But that's a subtle point (i.e., one you can't explain to
a Senator...).

I don't like the unit key generation process any better than you do.
However -- S1 and S2 are supposed to be under control of the same
escrow agents.  If they can't be trusted to keep the seed values secure,
they can't be trusted to keep the half-keys secure.

I still don't know if or when S1 and S2 change.  I thought I had seen
something about them being constant, but I just reread Denning's technical
information post, and it doesn't say anything, one way or the other.

The willingness of the majority of the people to give up their freedom in 
exchange for a sense of safety is hardly limited to the USA, and is an 
endemic problem in any human society of any appreciable size.  The structure 
of the US government does try to combat this tendency to some extent, but 
fighting entropy is always a losing battle.  Most people would rather have 
comfort than freedom.  The paradox is that you can't really have the former, 
in the long term, unless you have the latter.

One of the reasons that I probably come across to some people as a weird 
cross between a libertarian and an "establishment tool" is that I end up 
taking an utterly pragmatic view of government.  I don't get up in arms when 
the government fails to protect the interests of the people, because in my 
lifetime it never has--therefore, I have no expectation that it will.  

As a result, I protect my own interests rather than expecting the government 
to be "fair".  I will use strong cryptography when I think it is needed, 
whether or not it is legal at the time.  Same thing with anything else the 
government would rather not see in private hands--that's their problem.  
What's important to me is using the right tool for the job.  If it's legal, 
so much the better.  If it is not, but does not violate my (very strong) 
sense of personal ethics, I will use it anyway as long I think it is worth 
it.  Expecting the government to actually protect the interests of its 
citizens, except by accident, is utter folly.  Even Jefferson, one of the 
major architects of the American system of government, figured that in a 
couple hundred years it would become so corrupt and self-serving that it 
would be time dismantle it and try again, by revolution if necessary.  I 
agree, and while I don't go around trying to spark one, I'll certainly 
participate if it happens when I'm around.  There is a reason I am such a 
strong supporter of individual rights while being so cynical about politics.  
I've already written off politics.

And yes, this may get me in trouble some day.  If so, so be it.  I drive 
faster than 55 MPH, too.

Now I wouldn't be the one to claim that you are injecting some
disinformation into the net, Andrew, but 'paranoia' refers to
unwarranted or excessive suspicions or fear, not those that
have reasonable roots.

Let's start with looking at the professionals, the NSA itself.
Its birth was by secret executive order by Harry S Truman
in 1952.  Until even 1976 not even one word of this executive
order chartering the NSA was sealed.  Paranoia, right?

On the outside of the NSA complex is a ten foot Cyclone fence
with multiple rows of barbed wire, with high voltage, complete with signs
prohibiting even making sketches under penalty of the Internal
Security Act.  The area is completely scanned by closed circuit
television.  More paranoia.

These are professionals,  Maybe they know something we don't, eh?

Do you think it would have helped Admiral Yamamoto if the Japanese
had been a little more 'paranoid' of their purple cipher?

Or maybe the Germans should have been a little more 'paranoid' about
their Engima with respect to Turing and the British.

How about the cracking of the Zimmerman telegram?  Would a little
more paranoia have helped the Germans here?

Maybe the NSA should have been a little more 'paranoid' about
Emma Woikin, or Joseph Sidney Petersen, Jr., or  ...

Maybe you want to talk about Macmillan publishers cooperation
with the CIA and NSA to suppress Yardley's Japanese Diplomatic
Secrets or even Kahn's The Codebreakers.. paranoia, right?

The most popular cipher systems in captured soviet spies was
the one-time pad, even with the necessity of keeping incriminating
evidence about, is known to be the only proven unbreakable system.
Soviet paranoia, right?

And what do you think the NSA does with its Wullenwebers?  And 
huge Rhombics pointed embassy row?  And their sites near
satellite uplink and downlink sites?  Duh.

When I worked in a classified MITRE communications lab at one time
even with a "secret" clearance I had to be escorted to the toilet
and the entire site was built INTO a Mosler-type vault with *very*
thick bomb-proof door.  MITRE paranoia?

I could cite probably a hundred more facts which all support, as
best hypothesis, the notion that the NSA is grabbing as much as
it can, as fast as it can.  One would be a fool to ignore the
pattern of facts and conclude that they were random...

And we know the government is violent -- even against children as
recent events prove.  Judge William Sessions is a disgrace
but a solemn warning to those who ignore the web of evidence
that our government institutions have in their contempt for our
civil rights.

And of course we have to err somewhat on the excessive side of
caution because that does much less harm than erring on the
reckless side. As member of the crew of the USS Liberty might aver.

I might suggest, Andrew, that you read Kahn's Codebreakers and
Bamford's Puzzle Palace and come back with some more facts to
support your sheepish acquiescence to authority.

	The Clipper standard *is* the first step toward outlawing other
strong encryption standards.  If the government didn't intend to outlaw
other forms of encryption, than Clipper is just a big waste of time and money.
Why, you ask?  Because anyone who is transferring data that any government
agency could use against him/her would be a total fool to use the Clipper
system..So why add the backdoor-key if all lawbreakers will use alternate
encryption methods? Because they assume they can just do away with everything
else.
	I, for one, am planning on boycotting any equipment that contains
clipper technology.

As one of the happily sleeping people, I would just like to ask this->
aren't people just slightly overreacting to this?  Or are we all of a
sudden going to draw parallels to Nazi Germany and Communist Russia?

The point of the matter is that; yes this is a serious problem.  But it is
not the end of the world.  Guess what?  We're doing something now you
can't do in a Communist country or Nazi Germany.  We're complaining about
it, (or rather, you're complaining about it) and nobody is shooting at us.  

(Or, rather, if they're shooting at me, they have real bad aim.  (:-) )

GUESS WHAT PEOPLE?  You live in one of the few countries in the world
where a person can complain without getting shot at.  

People are always complaining that somebody did this wrong, or somebody
did that wrong, or whatever.  Sit down and figure out two things:

1)  What have they done right?
2)  How much worse can it get?

And you'll find that you and I, are pretty damn lucky.

So let's talk about it, get some action going, decide what's going on. 
But let's not overreact!

Generally, an organization has influence in proportion to:

	The narrowness of its objectives
	The number of members
	The strength of belief of its members

This is why the pro- and anti-abortion groups are so strong: narrow objectives,
lots of interested members who are real passionate.

For this reason, mixing with the NRA is probably a bad idea.  It diffuses
the interests of both groups.  It may well diminish the Passion Index
of the combined organization.  It is not clear it would greatly enlarge
the NRA.

So, I believe a new organization, which may cooperate with NRA where the
two organization's interest coincide, is the optimum strategy.

A good vocoder like ours will give you 8000 bits per second locked at
full rate (it's a variable rate voice activity vocoder).  If you want
less quality, cut that to 4000 bps (half rate).  At full rate variable
you could put two full-duplex conversations on a V.32bis modem.  This
requires a DSP or ASICs, though.  An RS-6000 has a CPU that could
probably do it in real-time, because it has the add-and-multiply
instruction and a few other DSP things.

If you want to do speech in real-time you need about 4000 samples a
second (for not very good voice) with your 8 bit samples (ISDN is 8000
8-bit samples a second), which is 32 kbps.  You could do a fast 2:1
compression on that to get it down to 16 kbps, which is just about
V.32bis.  The quality at this point is very bleah, but it should work.
Now add in the time for your encryption method.  You're going to need
sampling hardware, which is no problem on a new Mac, an Amiga.  Or a
PC with a SoundBlaster card (just because they're so popular and cheap
- you could also build a simple ADC).  The problem with the
SoundBlaster is that it doesn't seem to be full duplex - you can't
sample and play backq at the same time, making a two-way conversation
a bit tough.  The special hardware or a more capable sound card may be
required.

The only thing that worries me is that 2:1 compression - the
SoundBlaster can do it automatically in hardware, but other than that
I don't have a good feel for how processor intensive it is, so I can't
estimate how fast a PC you'd need.

Without getting into the *really* *thorny* questions about reverse
engineering and all of that, let me just point out that there already
exist gate arrays and suchlike that have what's known as a security fuse
which can be programmed after you've verified all other programming --
this makes it impossible to read out the programming of the device
(again, ignoring the reverse engineering questions).  Speaking from
experience here: I had to completely reinvent one of my designs some
six or seven years ago when the disk file was zapped, the backups were
all bad, and the devices were unreadable because of the security fuses.
Made me appreciate the value of printouts.  ;-)

So on this point at least there's not so much worry.

But whether or not we can get the chips made reliably and securely is
really secondary to the question of whether use of the chip is itself
likely to be secure, methinks.

	[Prof. Denning's description of SkipJack mostly omitted]

	CHIP STRUCTURE
	The Clipper Chip contains a classified 64-bit block encryption
	algorithm called "Skipjack."  The algorithm uses 80 bit keys (compared
	with 56 for the DES) and has 32 rounds of scrambling (compared with 16
	for the DES).  It supports all 4 DES modes of operation.  Throughput is
	16 Mbits a second. [...]

	F, an 80-bit family key that is common to all chips
	N, a 30-bit serial number
	U, an 80-bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted
		 with the chip
	The key K and message stream M (i.e., digitized voice) are then
	fed into the Clipper Chip to produce two values:

  	   E[M; K], the encrypted message stream, and 
	   E[E[K; U] + N; F], a law enforcement block.  

Three questions:
1) It looks like each 64 bits of input gives you 4*64 bits of output:
		E[M;K] = 64 bits
		E[K;U] = E[ 80 bits ] = 128 bits
		E[ E[K;U], N ; F ] = E[ 128 + 30 bits ] = 192 bits
   Do you really need to transmit all 256 bits each time,
   or do you only transmit the 192 bits of wiretap block at the beginning?   
   All 256 would be really obnoxious for bandwidth-limited applications
   like cellular phones (or even regular phones over 

2) how do the 4 DES modes interact with the two-part output?
   Do the various feedback modes only apply to the message block,
   or also to the wiretap block?  Or, if the wiretap block is only
   transmitted at the beginning, does it get incorporated into
   everything through feedback modes, but not during ECB mode?

3) Does the Clipper Chip check the wiretap block itself?
   Does the block have to be present at all?
   Since the receiving chip doesn't know the transmitter's U,
   it presumably can't check the validity of E[K;U], so it's 
   limited to checking the *form* of the wiretap block,
   and maybe checking the serial number for reasonableness
   (unless there's some sort of back-door structure that lets
   it recognize a valid E[K;U].)
   
   In that case, can you replace the wiretap block with a DIFFERENT
   wiretap block, presumably an old valid one to avoid attracting attention?
   (The chip won't do it, so you postprocess the output.)
   Regular people can do one with their own serial number and a dummy key;
   paranoid people can use someone else's serial number.

   On the other hand, if I could think of that solution so easily,
   presumably the NSA could too - have they done something to block it,
   like use message encryption that's really E[M; K,U,N] ?

What???  This is an incredible statement!  The NSA tried to suppress
public key crypto and RSA, and yet they claim to encourage use of
strong crypto for US citizens.

Would you trust a black-box from the NSA versus an "open system" from
elsewhere?

One more time...

    If they released the algorithm, it would be possible for someone
    to come up with an implementation which was identical, but
    lacking an escrowed key.

    Note that the press announcement mentioned that the algorithm was
    being kept secret for security of the key escrow system.  In this
    case security means "an escrowed key for EVERY clipper chip".


    Assuming you believed all that is said about the effective of
    the algorithm, and the escrow system, which would you buy :

     (a)  Chip from firm A with the escrowed key
     (b)  Second source chip from reputable firm B with no key
          in government escrow.

    There would obviously be powerful economic incentives for a second
    source, non escrowed, vendor.

And some people thought that I am exaggerating when claiming that the
Cripple Chip is just a first step in a totalitarian plot against the
civil liberties in the USA... It seems that I've even been an optimist
- the things are happening even faster than I expected.... That's
another of the dirty tricks they used to apply on us under the
communist regime - do something secret, THEN tell the people about is
(after the fact, when nothing can be done any more), and of course,
explaining them how much better the situation is now...

In my previous messages I wrote that the Americans should wake up and
fight against the new proposal. Now it seems to me that it is already
too late - it has already happened, the civil liberties have been
violated, no, stollen from the American people, while the most part of
this people has been sleeping happily... :-((( Too sad...

I guess the cryptowranglers read this group too.  But of
course I knew that because it is so easy to do.  There is
not a single doubt in my mind that every byte that passes
every significant gateway or 'bone is captured for the
colligation of data about __________?  (Maybe your name is here).

Maybe we should start a newsgroup for the distribution of encrypted 
posts intended of members of affinity groups with a shared private
key.  For example at the coming up Cypherpunks meeting, a private
key corresponding to that particular meeting could be passed out
by a moderator.  Minutes, followup comments to other participants,
and so on could be posted to the alt.encrypted group for the use
of the people who attended. Communiques intended by the group for
non-attendees could of course just be signed using the private key
but otherwises not encrypted.

Starting a alt.encrypted newsgroup rather than just maintaining
mailing lists is better for several reasons.  First, it would be
easier to archive for people who might join a group "late" and
who might like to easily read earlier posts; second, traffic analysis
to know exactly to whom an affinity message is directed would be foiled;
three, a newsgroup is much more public and would serve to publicize
available privacy measures on the internet.

And it would be fun to accumulate a secret keyring full of such
keys -- it beats giving out t-shirts as a door prize.

We could send a copy of alt.encrypted directly to Judge William
Sessions or Admiral Studeman to save them the time of having it
collected for them.

    Of course, nothing prevents you from buying a new lock with cash
and installing it yourself. Even modifying the core to match some
arbitrary key is not difficult to do at home. I once knew someone who
had fixed his locks in this way - his house, office and cars all took
the same key (which he took GOOD care of :-)

    Very bad (yours, that is). Have you ever had a safety deposit box?
They work on a two-key system. The bank clerk has one, and you have
the other (they are different keys). The bank does NOT keep a copy of
your key. If you lose it, they have to drill out the lock, and replace
the door. This is a time consuming and expensive process (which they
will be happy to charge to your account :-).

     This process is exactly analogous to having a private key which
is NOT in a escrow system, and the state having to crack your cipher
to get the data.

     Please do not use false analogies.

Hmmm, this gave me an interesting idea.  How about this argument:

1)  Second Amendment gives us the right to keep and bear arms.

2)  Strong cryptography is "arms", according to the U.S. government (that's
    why it's so hard to export).

Therefore, we have a constituitional right to strong cryptography!  
Q.E.D.

However, it's likely to be as hard or harder to exercise this right as it
is getting to exercise the other rights that the government is slowly
restricting.  Maybe the NRA _would_ be the best existing organization?
(Although I think a new one might be better, but perhaps would take too long
to start up.  I would certainly join.)

  If the device is designed to use the key that's registered with the Feds,
I don't see how you -can- feed it a different key.  If the user can change
the key to any of the 2^80 possibilities, the main reason for regarding
this proposal as unacceptable disappears.

I hope there is something I don't understand about this system, but can
someone tell me how these chips are going to be manufactured while maintaining
each half key under total control of the separate escrow agencies? Don't
both halfs of the key have to come together (in some form) at the time
the chip is constructed?

Or is it built like a fusable prom, with the chip being sent to the 1st
escrow agency to program its 1/2 key, then the 2nd agency to program its
1/2 key (but who invents the safeguards that prevent the 2nd agency from
reading the information already programmed by the 1st)?

This isn't intended to be a flame or anything, I am just really curious
how to manufacture these things while still maintaining the key escrow
security without simply saying "trust the manufacturer, they won't look".

Now why would anyone "post" anything encrypted? Encryption is only of 
use between persons who know how to decrypt the data.

And why should I care what other people look at? 

What does concern me is the continued erosion of my constitutional
rights. ( Amendments I, II, IV, and V to note a few. )

I was responding to another person (Tarl Neustaedter) who held that the
EFF wasn't the best organization to fight for crytography rights since the
EFF also supports the right to distribute pornography over the internet,
something some Crypto people might object to. In other words, he's
implying that there are people who will protect any speech, just  as long
as it is encrypted.

I must protest your "...in a Communist country". How do you know?
There haven't been any, and are unlikely to ever be any. In some Socialist
dictatorships, you can't, whilst in some socialist democracies
(such as France or Australia)
you can. Of course, some people may disagree about France & Australia being
socialist...

In some circumstances. I was at a public meeting last night (in the USA), where
a protester, who was very nice and calm, and just said before the
speaker started to beware of his opinions, was forced out of the meeting by
two armed policemen.

There are a lot of things that one cannot do in the USA. You may not
notice them, but as an Australian visitor, I notice them.

I hope there are some silicon jocks on the committee who can follow
the algorithm through to hardware.  While I doubt the NSA would pull
any monkey business on this point -- they have to expect that the
chip will be reverse-engineered sooner or later -- it's an obvious
opportunity to introduce additional holes.

carries as much undesireable baggage for me as the EFF and CPSR do
for others.

The NRA is successful because (among a number of things), on the drop of
a hat, they can get a congresspersons office flooded with postcards,
faxes and phone calls.  Certainly, with our way-cool Internet powers of
organization, we can act in the same way, if such action is appropriate.

As long as we are kept informed of events, anyone on this bboard can make
a call to action.  Hopefully, we're a strong enough community to act on
those calls.  I realize this is a little optomistic, and I'm glad EFF is
working in the loop on these issues, but don't underestimate the
potential of the net for political action.

   That doesn't worry me at all; they're not going to cheat at something
   they can get caught at.  And key size is one of the things that can be
   verified externally.  Feed lots of random key/input pairs into the
   chip, then try flipping random key bits, and see what happens to the
   output.  We already know what *should* happen -- about half the output
   bits should vary, on average, from a 1-bit key change or input change.

   If they were out to build a weak cryptosystem, it might be the case that
   some of the bits are much less powerful than others, in the sense that
   they only enter into the encryption very late in the game.  By contrast,
   DES was designed to use each key bit as early as possible; the 50% output
   change rate appears as early as round 5.  Again, though, I don't think
   NSA is going to cheat that crudely; they're likely to get caught.

Consider a cryptosytem that starts out by XORing bits 23 and 47, and
not using either of these bits except through this XOR. This system
makes early use of every bit. but an exhaustive key search would now
only have 2^79 keys to search. Your test by varying single key bits
wouldn't turn up anything interesting.

   Remember that they've promised to let a committee of outside experts see
   the cryptosystem design.  If you assume something DES-like, a biased
   subkey generation schedule will stick out like a sore thumb.

The algorithm I suggest above would stick out like a sore thumb, but
I'm sure I could design a system with a more subtle key redundancy
which was well-hidden, but would still make an exhaustive key search
take far less than 2^80 encryptions. I don't believe your claim that
the real keysize can be verified externally.

As far as I know ISDN (call it Swissnet here, and it's being plugged in) it's
8 bit 8000Hz (gives you one channel of 64kBit/sec) I guess you should not go

ONLY IF this chip catches on. Which means alternatives have to be
developed. Which will only happen if Clipper is discredited.

That's nothing.  They wouldn't let the British buy Inmos Transputer systems
because of security concerns.  And we designed the damn things!

   As promised, I spoke today with the company mentioned in a Washington
Times article about the Clipper chip announcement. The name of the company
is Secure Communicatiions Technology (Information will be given at the end
of this message on how to contact them).

   Basically they are disturbed about the announcement for many reasons that
we are. More specifically however, Mr. Bryen of Secure Communications
brought to light many points that might interest most of the readers.

   His belief is that AT&T was made known of the clipper well before the
rest of the industry. This is for several reasons, several of which are:

 - A company of AT&T's size could never be able to make a decision to use
   the new chip on the SAME DAY it was announced.

 - Months ago they proposed using their own chip for AT&T's secure telephone
   devices. AT&T basically blew them off as being not interested at all.
   This stuck them as strange, until now...


   Also I spoke with Art Melnick, their cryptographer, he expressed several
concerns over the new Clipper Chip:

  - The obvious backdoor will be able to let many people decrypt the code.

  - Once the key is released to authorities the security of the crypto
    system is lost forever. These keys can end up in the hands of any agency
    of the government.

  - The fact that the escrowed keys never change means that the algorithm
    is vulnerable over time to an attacker.

  - The classified algorithm may hide another backdoor. But he feels that
    it is probably to keep people from forging fake serial numbers, or
    changing the keys themselves.

  - Additionally he feels that the NSA has probably spent enough time and
    money in working on a way to keep this chip from being reversed
    engineered, that he feels that reverse engineering it will be very
    difficult to do. He feels that they have developed a suitable technique
    to protect the chip from this attack. Also he feels that the chip is
    hardware encoded with the algorithm and not microcoded onto the chip.

Additonally I spoke with Mr. Melnick about their algorithm. He couldn't tell
me much about their new agorithm because it hasn't been patented yet.
However he told me a little:

 - The algorithm will be released for public review after patents have been
   granted for it. This is so the crypto community can see that it is
   secure.

 - The algorithm is called NEA for New Encryption Algorithm.
   The details were sketchy because now it is held as a trade secret
   until the patent was issued, but I was told that it will incorporate
   the following:

    - It will have fast encryption of data (Exact specs not given, but
      Mr. Melnick stated "Much faster than what an RS-232 can put out.")

    - It is a symmetric cipher, just like IDEA and DES.

    - It will use 64 bit data blocks for encryption (like DES and IDEA).

    - The key length was not given to me, but Mr. Melnick states that
      it is _adujustable_ and is "More than adequate for security."

    - The algorithm is written in C and Assembler in software form, and
      can be ported to many platforms (Unlike the the Clipper Chip which
      is hardware ONLY and cannot be made into software) This I
      consider a definite plus for the NEA for widespread use.

    - The algorithm will accomodate public key distribution techniques
      such as RSA or Diffie-Hellman. This will also be supported in the
      hardware chip.

    - Right now the projected cost of the NEA chip will be about 10 dollars
      for each!! (Clipper will run 25 each chip [that is if it is produced
      enough, which probably won't happen]).

    - They currently sell a program called C-COM that uses the algorithm
      and a special streaming protocol that does not divide the encrypted
      data into "blocks." This could prevent plaintext attacks if you know
      what the block header is. This program operates at all supported
      RS-232 speeds and uses the software implementation of the algorithm.

    - Most importantly: IT DOES NOT HAVE A BACKDOOR!!



Right now the company is afraid that the new clipper chip will put them out
of business. This is a very real possibility. So they really need help in
stopping the clipper chip from becoming a standard. If you want to contact
them, they can be reached at..

Note: I am *not* a cable freak, so I might have completely
misunderstood what you said.  Also, my math is frequently noted for
being wrong, so you'll better check the calculations yourself.

I assume that 14.4K means 14.4K Bits.  So if we assume one start and
one stopbit, and no protocol overhead, the effective number of bytes
per second is 1.44K.

Let's also assume that you do not want to transmit your speech in
stereo, so that you can send 1,440 samples/sec.  This corresponds to a
Nyquist frequency of 720 Hz, which should be too low, especially if
you think about the 8-bit low quality sound.  Furthermore, your D/A
converter will probably not present you with a signal that has been
cut off at 720 Hz, but will instead alias in all the higher
frequencies.  (Although you can definitely build a filter to overcome
that problem.)

On the other hand, speech should be easily compressible.  For example,
you could form power spectra, or you could simply band-pass filter and
then linearize the fourier transforms.  It won't be CD quality sound,
but it'll be discernible.  The power spectrum method is very good in
that respect.  I have once programmed such a software compressor, and
compression rates of 90% with relative errors due to linearization of
less than 5% were common.  Although I must say that these were musical
sounds, not speech.

Have fun.

But what about second sources for pin-compatible non-Clipper algorithm
chips that also have escrowed keys?  If a "reputable firm" produces a
chip (with escrowed key) that is a pop-in replacement for the Clipper
chip in my phone, and uses an algorithm that is widely known and evaluated
and "trusted," then what's the problem?

The Clipper is going to be reverse engineered anyway by any organization
with sufficient resources (can you say "billions of cocaine dollars?") so
those drug dealers they're so worried about will be slipping through the
cracks.  We law-abiding (non-incredibly-wealthy) citizens, naturally, will
not have this recourse.  But claiming that the algorithm can't be
released to prevent people from using non-key-escrowed chips is plain
deceitful... analysis of the chip output will provide information on
the necessary headers and whatnot, so the "bad guys" could build chips
using a *different* algorithm and still not escrow their keys.

Or, they could just buy bunches of cheap phones at K-mart every week,
and play Swap-the-Clipper-Chip with their cellular phone every day.

Preventing black market chips w/non-escrowed keys IS exactly what they
mean by protecting the security of the key escrow system.  There are
two parts to the security of such a system:
  
    (a) Preventing decruption by unauthorized personel
    (b) Assuring that the gummit can always decrypt clipper
        traffic when it authorizes itself to do so.

Of course, the ministry of propoganda will do a lot of tallking about

This is outright illegal.  It DOES violate the first amendment.  If you
would, give a case in which your "speed trap" example has been upheld by
the courts.

The problem with "Let's assume" reasoning is that, taken to the extreme
(and you're close), you arrive at "Let's assume this is perfectly OK."

The assumptions you make are big ones. If the system is really secure, then
why does the government have to keep the algorithm secret?  There are plenty
of encryption algorithms that don't depend upon nondisclosure to be secure,
so why in the world use one that does?  There are reasons, of course, but
I certainly can't think of any honest ones.

Next, you assume we can "trust" the escrow houses. But the last time I checked,
EVERY SINGLE BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT has experienced unauthorized disclosure,
corruption, and even fabrication, of supposedly secure data. The govt is
saying "Yeah, but NOW we're serious, so you can trust us."  Bullcrypt. 

And finally, although you didn't state it explicitly, you implicitly assume
that the warrant mechanism in this country is safe and reasonable. The case
in Ventura County of a man shot and killed by officers serving a deliberately
fraudulant warrant tells me that the govt has a long ways to go on this
score.

Remember that all this is to catch the drug dealers, right?  As others
have pointed out, the current proposal will, if deployed, render truly secure
encryption much more expensive and inconvenient than Uncle Sam's brand.
Who will be able to afford, and be sufficiently motivated, to purchase this
expensive, inconvenient higher protection?  Somebody with lots of extra
cash...

The following is more true than ever:

  "When [strong] encryption is outlawed, only outlaws will have [strong]
encryption."

David,

  As an economist, I'm sure you can see the flaws in this logic. If the (naive)
market is flooded with proprietary, but weak, encryption, then truly strong 
encryption will be unable to compete. Suppose the govt had a secret TV broadcast
standard, and then sold TVs below cost. Private industry has a better standard,
but it's not as widespread due to the govt early flooding of the market
with cheap proprietary sets. Even though the industry's technology is better,
the programming is being broadcast to the govt's unduplicatable standard.
Who could compete?

  The other flaw, of course, is that making something voluntary today ensures
that it will be voluntary in the future. I went to renew my CA drivers license
last week and was required not only to give my SSN, but to PRODUCE AN SSN
CARD to veryify the number!  Note that a federal law once said that no state
or local govt could ever require the use of SSNs for drivers license registration
(specifically!).

   I do not trust the govt that says "trust me on this even though we could
have an arrangement that doesn't require your trust."  Something is big
time fishy. If you look more carefully, you'll see it.

It might be nice to:

1. cut out the ad hominem attacks on Prof. Denning, Mr. Sternlight,
etc.  If you have something objective to say about their views, go
ahead and say it (subject to point 2.).  Personal attacks reflect more
on the attacker more than on the attackee.  Throw light, not heat!

To me, a larger problem is that once disclosed, your keys could be used
to decrypt any previously recorded conversations. I gather that from this
proposal a warrant would be required to get the keys, but not to collect
conversations! Consider the scenario where an agency collects preemptively
all encrypted conversations for certain people likely to be targets (and
not necessarily "legitimate" targets), then arranges for some unrelated
incident that can trigger a warrant:

   "Your honor, we know that the suspect has received calls from noted 
crime figure Bugsy Butthead [said calls arranged by the agency] and we must 
therefore have this warrant to determine whether this suspect, in a
sensitive govt post, is corrupt."

  I suppose that it is conceivable that there are session keys involved
somewhere, but that doesn't seem likely; if there are, why wouldn't the
technical overview mention them when it goes to such details as the number
of bits held by each escrow authority?

  This scheme is full of holes, and stinks to high heaven.

I don't find this a credible argument, for two reasons.  One you have
supplied below: unless I care about entering the USA at any time in the
future (eg. the Taiwanese backyard cloners - who BTW have been known to
decap custom silicon and reproduce it on daughterboards when pirating
high-profit arcade machines and the like - who wouldn't care less), I am not 
going to care much about US confidentiality, am I?  Only people like the
real me, who does care about travelling to various countries for business
reasons, will sit up and follow laws like this, but I would contend that
we're not the main threat.

I also have grave doubts whether an algorythm widely distributed in silicon
could possibly be called "classified."  It's like handing out military
secrets to the whole world in envelopes marked "don't open me."  I can
imagine several credible defences which could be employed if it came to
a trial.  One would be the stupidity of the government's actions.

Amusing thought: could they have employed an algorythm which is infeasable
for a fast software implementation, but which is easy in custom hardware?
In DES, the extensive use of permutation tables (trivial in hardware: you
just swap bus lines), but relatively slow in software have had a big effect
on the speed difference between hardware and software implementations of
that cipher (indeed, I suspect that Lucifer's designers were well aware that
it would be, and approved.)  Certain algorythms (usually parallel search
algorythms) can be very slow in software, yet can fly in custom hardware.
I have no proof of their employment in Clipper -- it is pure conjecture.  
However, as a software implementation of this cipher is something that its 
designers would have been trying to avoid at all costs, then the inclusion 
of such techniques seems credible.

Hmmm... I also wonder what Intergraph thinks about the use of the name
"Clipper" for this device. :)

I must admit that this point has been running through my mind for most of
the discussion: one the dice are out there, it won't be long before someone
decaps it and, after a bit of work, has full details of the Clipper
algorythm.  This isn't trivial to do, but then again, it is not impossibly
difficult either.  Any half way decent VLSI design student should be able
to take a photograph of a technology s/he is familiar with, and given a
description of the input, output, control and supply lines, figure out 
the function of various subsystems on the die.  Indeed, this is not an
uncommon exercise performed during training (because it makes you think
about design decisions made by other designers.

I could speculate that these chips are going to be manufactured using
"tamperproof" carriers (unlikely - such techniques are *very* expensive
and this thing is supposed to be relatively cheap to produce), or that
there will be some legal or legislative framework to prevent publication
of the algorythm (unlikely - please correct me if I am wrong but aren't these
supposed to be sold internationally?).  I suppose that the most likely
reason the algorythm is remaining secret for the moment is that some idiot
bureaucrat, untrammeled by the realities of the situation, decided that
"well, we should keep it a secret because it is supposed to be secret,
isn't it?"

Just some random thoughts...

What harm is there in overreacting?
This may be the largest single threat to civil liberties yet in my
lifetime.  The US has done some pretty heinous things in the past, 
and we haven't yet recovered from all of them.  There certainly seems
to be a historical trend towards less liberty, with occasional
perturbations.

	I really like these claims. Where did they come from? We hear,
practically daily, that the NSA monitors, oh, everything. They can
crack anything. They'd never release a cryptosystem they couldn't crack.

	Where do people get these fascinating facts? 'The Puzzle Palace'?
If you can get it for a buck, 2nd hand, it must be true, eh? I'm pretty
sure the NSA is supposed to, among many other things, provide high-quality
cryptosystems to a variety of places. I don't recall reading anywhere
reliable that they're supposed to:

	1) Monitor my phonecalls.
	2) Monitor usenet.
	3) Provide only cryptosystems they can easily crack.
	4) etc etc.

	This is not to say that they *don't*, they might. But you don't
know that they do, and you have no evidence that they do, for almost
all values of you. It follows, therefore, that for most values of 'you',
your claims about the NSA border on paranoia.

Having read the various "Clipper" announcements on the net over the last few 
days and a LOT of uninformed speculation about the chip, its uses,
government plots, etc, I have the following questions.

  1) What does the "Clipper chip" actually implement? Just the Skipjack
	cryptographic algorithm? Or does it also implement a "chip to chip"
	communications protocol? If it does implement a communications
	protocol, can it be used as just a "crypt chip" also.

  2) Where can the chip specifications and spec sheets be obtained?

  3) Who may purchase them and under what conditions?

  4) Are there restrictions as to how the chip may be used in a system?

  5) The security of the algorithm and the encrypted communications does
	not appear to require that the "Family key" be a secret. Why is
	it a secret? What happens when the "family key" becomes well known?
	If it's a secret to make traffic analysis more difficult, does
	the "Law enforcement message" contain any random information?
	How much and how random is it?

  6) Can the chip be programmed to reveal the "Unit key"? The chip "serial
	number"? Any of the programming parameters?

I agree with this assessment.  Furthermore, its promotion as
providing greater protection than bare voice is quite true, as far
as it goes.  However, the only way for it to fulfill its stated goal
of letting LE wiretap "terrorists and drug dealers" is to restrict
stronger techniques.  

Wiretap targets presently use strong encryption, weak encryption, or
(the vast majority) no encryption.  The latter two classes can be
tapped.  With weak encryption in every phone, the no-encryption
class is merged into the weak-encryption class.  Will the
introduction of Clipper cause targets presently enjoying strong
privacy to give up on it?  that is, to rely for privacy on a system
expressly designed to deny it to people like them?  I doubt it.  The
mere introduction of this scheme will give the government *nothing*.

The stated goal of preventing the degradation of wiretapping
capabilities can be fulfilled by restriction of domestic
cryptography, and only by this restriction.  "Clipper" appears to be
no more than a sop, given to the public to mute any complaints.  We
would find this a grossly inadequate tradeoff, but I fear the public
at large will not care.  I hate to even mention gun control, but
most people seem to think that an `assault weapon' (as the NYT uses
the word) is some sort of automatic weapon, .50 caliber maybe.  Who
wants to have such a thing legal?  Well, people know even less about
cryptology; I suspect that strong cryptography could easily be
labeled "too much secrecy for law-abiding citizens to need".

What they say is opinion, but what they do is what matters, and will
continue unless overturned.  And the courts are reluctant to annul
law or regulation, going to some length to decide cases on other
grounds.  Furthermore, Congress can get away with quite a bit.  They
could levy a burdensome tax; this would place enforcement in the
hands of the BATF, who as we've seen you really don't want on your
case.  They could invoke the Commerce Clause; this seems most
likely.  This clause will get you anywhere these days.  The 18th was
required because the Supreme Court ruled a prohibitory statute
unconstitutional.  In 1970 Congress prohibited many drugs, with a
textual nod to the Commerce Clause.  The Controlled Substances
Act of 1970 still stands.  I think the government could get away
with it.

Just to make sure everyone is clear on this: "it never has" refers to 
"protects", not "fails to protect"; i.e., in my lifetime I have never seen 
the U.S. government consistently protect the interest of U.S. citizens, 
except by accident.

It would be in a different location, so a directional antenna could
probably lock in on just the one monitor. Failing that, a phased array
could likely seperate the signals. Admittedly, this is expensive, but
so is all the rest of this stuff anyway.

At the company I worked for previously, I received a file that was des encryped
and the person that had sent it, went on vaction.  Rather than wait two weeks
I set up a straight frontal attack with one key at a time.  It only took two(2)
days to crack the file.  No, I don't have any faith in DES.

I totally agree.  But how do you propose we take government back?  They
obviously don't listen to the people or want the people to know who is
responsibile for what (a person telnetted the site of the Clipper chip
release, to see what the entity 'clipper' was, and got a few lists.
BUt when another person tried a bit later, the commands were disabled)
Does not sound like an Administration that wants to have any accountability
or information they don't control given to the people.  The secret
development and implimentation of the Clipper Chip decision further
backs that up.  You can bet unaurhorized encryption methods and software
will be considered 'terrorist tools' and also subject to civil forfeiture,
along with the systems that are running it.  YOU WATCH, SEE IF I AM WRONG.

The government is not going to be very cooperative about the people taking
it back.  And they have all the resources, unlimited access to the media
for propeganda, and almost all the guns (soon to be ALL the guns if
Clinton's agenda succeeds)...   Those that do not play ball?  Waco
might be a good example of what to expect...  The warrant (just released)
stated the reason for the raid was the BDs spent a very large sum
for weapons, over an undetermined amount of time.  I don't recall
spending a lot of money on guns, etc being illegal ... yet, that is.

Clinton might go down in history as the worst thing to ever happen to
the US of A. ... Now to be known as the 'Peoples Socalist Democratic
Republic of America'  (PSDRA).

Big Brother is LISTENING!!!

Probably cheaper than you think.  I'll bet some of my (and yours)
tax dollars become a subsidy for these chips.  If these chips don't
sell well, what's to stop the US government from 'giving' them

Because that will make private encryption stick out like a sore thumb
and the government will start to take a sharp interest in everything you

You are so correct - Clinton did not initiate it.  He just cast it in
GRANITE by implimenting, NOT stopping the DECISION.  I also stated in another
post I don't give a damn what administration does it, I still find it
totally unacceptable, and whoever impliments it or rams it down our throats
ought to be run out of office.

Also, Bush was not trying to deprive us of our Second Amendment rights.
Clinton is BUSTING HIS BUTT in that regard.  That reveals a total difference
in philosophy.  Clinton appears to support the idea of TOTAL people
control.  Eavesdropping whenever they feel like it, no real security
for the common person, and no ability to defend oneself against illegal
attack, from whatever source.  "Trust us, we will protect (and control)
you... if we don't find it inconvenient..."

Clinton has also shown his utter contempt for public disclosure and
accountability, as well.  He had plenty of time to change the policy.

HE DIDN'T.  HE EXPANDED ON IT.

I bet had Bush been in office, you would be in there howling louder
than I.

Here is a revised version of my summary which corrects some errors

                     THE CLIPPER CHIP: A TECHNICAL SUMMARY

                               Dorothy Denning

                           Revised, April 21, 1993


INTRODUCTION

On April 16, the President announced a new initiative that will bring
together the Federal Government and industry in a voluntary program
to provide secure communications while meeting the legitimate needs of
law enforcement.  At the heart of the plan is a new tamper-proof encryption
chip called the "Clipper Chip" together with a split-key approach to
escrowing keys.  Two escrow agencies are used, and the key parts from
both are needed to reconstruct a key.


CHIP CONTENTS

The Clipper Chip contains a classified single-key 64-bit block
encryption algorithm called "Skipjack."  The algorithm uses 80 bit keys
(compared with 56 for the DES) and has 32 rounds of scrambling
(compared with 16 for the DES).  It supports all 4 DES modes of
operation.  The algorithm takes 32 clock ticks, and in Electronic
Codebook (ECB) mode runs at 12 Mbits per second.

Each chip includes the following components:

   the Skipjack encryption algorithm
   F, an 80-bit family key that is common to all chips
   N, a 30-bit serial number (this length is subject to change)
   U, an 80-bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip

The chips are programmed by Mykotronx, Inc., which calls them the
"MYK-78."  The silicon is supplied by VLSI Technology Inc.  They are
implemented in 1 micron technology and will initially sell for about
$30 each in quantities of 10,000 or more.  The price should drop as the
technology is shrunk to .8 micron.


ENCRYPTING WITH THE CHIP

To see how the chip is used, imagine that it is embedded in the AT&T
telephone security device (as it will be).  Suppose I call someone and
we both have such a device.  After pushing a button to start a secure
conversation, my security device will negotiate an 80-bit session key K
with the device at the other end.  This key negotiation takes place
without the Clipper Chip.  In general, any method of key exchange can
be used such as the Diffie-Hellman public-key distribution method.

Once the session key K is established, the Clipper Chip is used to
encrypt the conversation or message stream M (digitized voice).  The
telephone security device feeds K and M into the chip to produce two
values:

   E[M; K], the encrypted message stream, and 
   E[E[K; U] + N; F], a law enforcement field , 

which are transmitted over the telephone line.  The law enforcement
field thus contains the session key K encrypted under the unit key U
concatenated with the serial number N, all encrypted under the family
key F.  The law enforcement field is decrypted by law enforcement after
an authorized wiretap has been installed.

The ciphertext E[M; K] is decrypted by the receiver's device using the
session key:

   D[E[M; K]; K] = M .


CHIP PROGRAMMING AND ESCROW

All Clipper Chips are programmed inside a SCIF (Secure Compartmented
Information Facility), which is essentially a vault.  The SCIF contains
a laptop computer and equipment to program the chips.  About 300 chips
are programmed during a single session.  The SCIF is located at
Mykotronx.

At the beginning of a session, a trusted agent from each of the two key
escrow agencies enters the vault.  Agent 1 enters a secret, random
80-bit value S1 into the laptop and agent 2 enters a secret, random
80-bit value S2. These random values serve as seeds to generate unit
keys for a sequence of serial numbers.  Thus, the unit keys are a
function of 160 secret, random bits, where each agent knows only 80.
  
To generate the unit key for a serial number N, the 30-bit value N is
first padded with a fixed 34-bit block to produce a 64-bit block N1.
S1 and S2 are then used as keys to triple-encrypt N1, producing a
64-bit block R1:

        R1 = E[D[E[N1; S1]; S2]; S1] .

Similarly, N is padded with two other 34-bit blocks to produce N2 and
N3, and two additional 64-bit blocks R2 and R3 are computed:  

        R2 = E[D[E[N2; S1]; S2]; S1] 
        R3 = E[D[E[N3; S1]; S2]; S1] .

R1, R2, and R3 are then concatenated together, giving 192 bits. The
first 80 bits are assigned to U1 and the second 80 bits to U2.  The
rest are discarded.  The unit key U is the XOR of U1 and U2.  U1 and U2
are the key parts that are separately escrowed with the two escrow
agencies.

As a sequence of values for U1, U2, and U are generated, they are
written onto three separate floppy disks.  The first disk contains a
file for each serial number that contains the corresponding key part
U1.  The second disk is similar but contains the U2 values.  The third
disk contains the unit keys U.  Agent 1 takes the first disk and agent
2 takes the second disk.  Thus each agent walks away knowing
an 80-bit seed and the 80-bit key parts.  However, the agent does not
know the other 80 bits used to generate the keys or the other 80-bit
key parts.  

The third disk is used to program the chips.  After the chips are
programmed, all information is discarded from the vault and the agents
leave.  The laptop may be destroyed for additional assurance that no
information is left behind.
 
The protocol may be changed slightly so that four people are in the
room instead of two.  The first two would provide the seeds S1 and S2,
and the second two (the escrow agents) would take the disks back to
the escrow agencies. 

The escrow agencies have as yet to be determined, but they will not
be the NSA, CIA, FBI, or any other law enforcement agency.  One or
both may be independent from the government.


LAW ENFORCEMENT USE

When law enforcement has been authorized to tap an encrypted line, they
will first take the warrant to the service provider in order to get
access to the communications line.  Let us assume that the tap is in
place and that they have determined that the line is encrypted with the
Clipper Chip.  The law enforcement field is first decrypted with the
family key F, giving E[K; U] + N.  Documentation certifying that a tap
has been authorized for the party associated with serial number N is
then sent (e.g., via secure FAX) to each of the key escrow agents, who
return (e.g., also via secure FAX) U1 and U2.  U1 and U2 are XORed
together to produce the unit key U, and E[K; U] is decrypted to get the
session key K.  Finally the message stream is decrypted.  All this will
be accomplished through a special black box decoder.


CAPSTONE: THE NEXT GENERATION

A successor to the Clipper Chip, called "Capstone" by the government
and "MYK-80" by Mykotronx, has already been developed.  It will include
the Skipjack algorithm, the Digital Signature Standard (DSS), the
Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA), a method of key exchange, a fast
exponentiator, and a randomizer.  A prototoype will be available for
testing on April 22, and the chips are expected to be ready for
delivery in June or July.

Exactly.

But I'll add another observation: if the chip does become a standard,
the algorithm won't _remain_ secret.

Leaving the government with the only remaining option: to make use
of un-escrowed keys illegal. Which won't begin to bother the terrorists

You seem to be assuming that all arrests are of equal value, and that
the use of wiretaps is spread uniformly among them.

Given this comparatively tiny number of wiretaps, and the associated
difficulty and cost involved (judges, technicians, etc) I expect that
law enforcement reserves the use of wiretaps for the most valuable
cases.  Since the "value" of an arrest can vary over an enormous range
(eg. jaywalking -> mass murder) I think your $5 million estimate may
be too low by a couple of orders of magnitude.

you can put 5 Gigabytes on one tape, you would need about 10 trillion

Excellent point, and there's a related point I'd like to make.
They'll have to back up these databases themselves, won't they?
How many tape copies will there be, and how secure will the
tapes be?  If they store them off-site, it wouldn't be too
hard to hijack them in transit.  If they're all kept on-site,
one good bomb attack by some group intent on freeing us from
the threat of government snooping will take care of the problem
once and for all.  I can see it now -- "Hi, we're from the

Could somebody provide an overview of the proposed systems using the
chip?  (Ought to see if ATT has a spec sheet)  Skipjack sounds like a
normal digital encryption algorithm, so the data path will have to be
	voice --> digitize --> compress --> encrypt 
Compression will be necessary to fit the data on the wire, unless
they want to wait for ISDN (that we should be so lucky...).  Feeding
pre-encrypted data into the compressor will cause it to chuckle at
you; you'd have to tap into the guts of the phone and hack either
the compressed data stream, or selected parts of the output stream
before it hits the modem.  Unless you want to pay for two fast
modems on top of the encryption, and just plug the box in between
your phone and the wall.

	After reading the debate over the Clipper, I have a few things to
add.

	First, most of the people I know who activly use encryption
privately do not care about most of the issues that surround this debate,
and any questions about what is or is not ok to use in the US. All they
care about is wether or not what they are using is secure or not. That,
after all IS the bottom line. 

	Second, if I look at all the people I know who use any form
of encryption at all, and this group spans people from the morons who
still insist that the DES is a good and secure standard, to people 
looking at trying to improve upon existing strategies, I can not think
of anyone of them who would approve blindly of a strategy that leaves
their methods open to abuse. The Clipper does this, because people make
mistakes by nature, and the US government is made up of people who are
just as vulnerable to mistakes as everyone else. 

	Third, since most of the people I know are at least marginaly
familiar with the vulnerabilities present in current software encryption
stratigies, I can't see how most of them are going to blindly trust that
someone will not figure out a good way to compromise the Clipper Chip.
That despite any strengths or weaknesses that may exist in it. So, I can 
not see a high degree of confidence developing in the chip.

	Fourth, when it comes to criminal abuse, sure there are many stupid
people out there. And yes, some will be open to being caught via the 
built in back door of the Clipper Chip. However, anyone who is going to
do any serious investigation of how best to secure their data is going
to run into that problem pretty damned fast and, I would assume, start
looking around for other easily obtainible methods of encryption. 


	If nothing else were avalible, none of this would be an issue. However,
the truth is that most private encryption users that I've ever run into
simply do not give a damn about the legal status of RSA or PGP or anything
else. If it works, they use it. This is not going to change either. I do
not think for a moment that anyone with serious criminal intent will be
slowed down by the advent of the Clipper Chip. It is all to easy to 
convert encrypted data into unintellgible garbage as it is, if anything,
the Clipper Chip just adds another tool to the user.


	The bottom line here is that people will use what works, and
unavoidibly, I'm sure most criminals would rather face an encryption
related charge than one which could potentialy lead to death penalty
charges in the case of criminals who murder as part of their conspiricy.
	The other thing that has struck me since the advent and wide 
useage of public encryption has begun is that quite simply the cat is
out of the bag (Or if you have an interest in snooping, Pandora's Box
has been opened), and this is not going to change. I've seen a blindness
to this that I've found utterly stunning, and the Clipper Chip, along
with the way it has been presented only confirms this to me to a larger
degree.

Useful?  I find his estimate of the annual value to law enforcement
of $5 million quite useful, if rough (e.g. wiretaps may be
preferentially used on otherwise-hard-to-catch criminals, resulting
in an underestimate).  This comes to twenty cents a head over the
U.S. population.  I would find some rigorous numbers on this quite
useful -- it would make for nice slogans: "Your privacy is worth

She hasn't.  Dorothy Denning has spent many years earning the
professional respect of her colleagues, and something won in this
manner is not easily lost.  Her support of the clipper -- no matter
how unpopular that position may be -- serves far more to enhance the
clipper's respectability than to diminish her own.

From Denning:

   the Skipjack encryption algorithm
   F, an 80-bit family key that is common to all chips
   N, a 30-bit serial number
   U, an 80-bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip

   E[M; K], the encrypted message stream, and 
   E[E[K; U] + N; F], a law enforcement block.  

Where the session key is K, and is transmitted encrypted in the unit Key U.
Which along with the serial number N is encrypted in the Family key F.

Presumably the protocol can be recovered (if by nothing else, differential
analysis).

Postulate if you will, a chip (or logic) sitting between the clipper chip
and its communications channel.  The function of this spoof chip is twofold:
    
	1) Transmit Channel

	    The spoof chip XORs the 30 bit encrypted serial number with
	    a secondary keying variable.  This renders the serial number
	    unrecoverable with just the family key

	2) Receive Channel

	    The spoof chip XORs the incoming encrypted serial number
	    with a secondary keying variable (assuming integrity of the
	    law enforcement block is necessary for local operation -
	    checksums, sequence control, etc.).

This has the net result of hiding the serial number.  It is probable theere is
a known plaintext pattern used as a filler in the block containing N (34 bits
as used in generating U, U1,U2) correctness of the law enforcement block
can be determined with only the family key F.  Whereas, no one has proposed
Federal Agencies be denied F, and because they could recover it themselves,
The correctness of the serial number can be tested by examining the pad bits
of N in E[N; F].

The one could selectively alter the law enforcement block as above, but the
mutilation could be detected.  A better approach would be to mutilate the
entire law enforcement block.  If it were done with a group encryption scheme
such as DES or (presumably) Skipjack, the chances the law enforcement block
can be recovered are lessened.

What do you want to bet the transmission protocol can be recognized and the
serial numbers decrypted in a target search?  When digital transmission
becomes widely available, would there be a requirement that clipper protocol
transmissions be refused when containing mutilated law enforcement blocks?

One way to avoid notice, would be to spoof protocol information of the block
containing M, as well as spoofing the law enforcement block.

The goal is to use a secure communications scheme, without redress to 
detection or key K interception (contained encrypted within the law
enforcement block).  The data stream is returned to its original state
for use by the clipper chip (or system) if required, for proper operation.

It is somewhat improbable that the entire protocol will be contained within
the clipper chip, yet likely that sequence of events will be tested for,
requiring a valid law enforcement block to be received before accepting
and decrypting E(M; K);

The spoof chip could be implemented anywhere in the protocols, including
on the resulting serial data stream.  Existing clipper products could
be subborned.  After all, they are high security encryption systems right?

Super encipherment/encryption could allow the chip to be used without
redress to detection of the use of the chip, or disclosure of the serial
number.  Security must be adequate to deny the serial number, which should
not be recoverable by other means.  One can see the use of cut outs for
procurring clipper phones, or once the number of units is high enough,
stealing them.  It would be a mistake on the part of authority, but nice
from a point of privacy, if the serial number N were not associated with
a particular clipper chip or lot of chips through the manufacturing and 
distribution process.  Hopefully the list of known missing or stolen
clipper serial numbers N encrypted with F, and the protocols are not 
sufficient plaintext to attact the super encrypted clipper stream.
This could be further made difficult by altering the temporal and or
spatial relationship of the clipper stream to that of the super encrypted
stream.

Detection of an encrypted stream could tip off the use of the aforementioned
scheme.

******************************************************************************

If you could capture valid law enforcement blocks not your own, and use
them in a codebook sustitution with your own, where they point to a valid
law enforcement block stored in a library utilizing a session key matching
the remainder of the transmission, you could simply out and out lie, yet
deliver to monitoring and/or hostile forces a seemingly valid law enforcement
block.   These captured law enforcement blocks would be used as authenticators,
such as in a manually keyed encryption system.  Fending this off would require
escalation in examining the protocols and blocks in the transmission.

The M code stream  might be independently attacked based on knowledge of
clipper chip protocols as revealed plaintext.  This could be invalidated
by changing the temporal and or spatial relationship of the clipper M stream
and the actual transmitted stream, under the control of a secure key
generator synchronized between endpoints.

The useful life time of captured law enforcement blocks might be limited
based on hostile forces using them as targets following transmission
interception.  You would need a large number of them, but, hey there's
supposed to be millions of these things, right?  Adding time stamps to
the encrypted law enforcement block is probably impractical, who wants
an encryption chip with a real time clock?

the session key authenticators.  The proviso that you don't mind your own
serial number being discovered.

d. denning just sent out further information of a new version of the clipper
chip.	If a hash function were to be embedded in a clipper M transmission
block reflecting the law enforcement block, it better not fall on 64 bit block
boundaries.  If it were a recognizeable datum, you could lie with it too.

I like the randomizer inclusion in the MYK-80.  I remember reading that
Intel had an approved random noise source on silicon, hence the ability
to put it Inside.

You ever think that Mykotronx sounds like one of those made up names of 
companies used as fronts for intelligence organizations?

My earlier argument that "Clipper will encourage state and local cops 
to commit criminal acts" is largely moot, now that we've learned that 
the FBI will perform the actual tap.  [It will encourage the *FBI* to
commit (even more) criminal acts, but that's not the point here.]

But this gives another avenue of attack on the Clipper proposal.  When
the EFF/ACLU/CPSR FOIA requests are made, they should ask for details
on the bureaucratic and equipment infrastructure that is proposed (or 
even already budgeted) for the FBI to service tapping requests -- for now
and the projected future. 

From these figures, estimate the number of Clipper-tap requests the FBI
is expecting.  Publish this figure.  Compare it on a per-capita basis
with the amount of tapping now known or suspected.

Also estimate how expensive it would be for the FBI to install more
Clipper-tapping stations, and how rapidly they could be built and
installed ... ie, get the "plus or minus" epsilon for the near future.

Might be a mite disturbing for J. Q. Public to know these things.

And despite all the technical details [BTW, thanks to those who've been
providing them!], we still don't know 

1) how the tapping requests will be transmitted and authenticated (though
   it isn't too hard to guess a good scheme).

2) how the results will be securely transmitted (Fed Ex the audio tapes?)

3) how privacy will be re-established when an investigation is complete.

I don't have the wiretap statute handy.  But here's what the law says
on pen registers.  This is all from Title 18 of the U.S. Code.  Note
how vague S. 3125(a)(1)(B) is....  I haven't had a chance to check
out 50 U.S.C. 1801 yet.

----

18 USC  S. 3121 Pen Registers (as of 4/93)


S. 3121. General prohibition on  pen register  and trap and trace device
use; exception

   (a) In general. Except as provided in this section, no person may
install or use a  pen register  or a trap and trace device without first
obtaining a court order under section 3123 of this title or under the
Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (50 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.).

.....

S. 3125.  Emergency  pen register  and trap and trace device
installation

   (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter , any
investigative or law enforcement officer, specially designated by the
Attorney General, the Deputy Attorney General, the Associate Attorney
General, any Assistant Attorney General, any acting Assistant Attorney
General, or any Deputy Assistant Attorney General, or by the principal
prosecuting attorney of any State or subdivision thereof acting pursuant
to a statute of that State, who reasonably determines that--

   (1) an emergency situation exists that involves--

   (A) immediate danger of death or serious bodily injury to any person;
or

   (B) conspiratorial activities characteristic of organized crime,

   that requires the installation and use of a  pen register  or a trap
and trace device before an order authorizing such installation and use
can, with due diligence, be obtained, and

   (2) there are grounds upon which an order could be entered under this
chapter to authorize such installation and use "may have installed and
use a  pen register  or trap and trace device if, within forty-eight
hours after the installation has occurred, or begins to occur, an order
approving the installation or use is issued in accordance with section
3123 of this title."

   (b) In the absence of an authorizing order, such use shall
immediately terminate when the information sought is obtained, when the
application for the order is denied or when forty-eight hours have
lapsed since the installation of the  pen register  or trap and trace
device, whichever is earlier.

   (c) The knowing installation or use by any investigative or law
enforcement officer of a  pen register  or trap and trace device
pursuant to subsection (a) without application for the authorizing order
within forty-eight hours of the installation shall constitute a
violation of this chapter.

Apart from the storage and search requirements, because the evidence
is inadmissible:  wiretaps require a warrant.  And as soon as one
such case comes to light, all previous cases are likely to be discovered,
and thrown out.  There was an article in the NY Times a few months ago
about how many convictions in the state might be invalidated because
they relied on pen registers -- and the Court of Appeals ruled that
pen registers were equivalent to wiretaps, and hence required warrants
under New York law.


I agree that notifying your elected officials of your feelings on this
(and any other, for that matter) issue is the way to go.  And by the
way, the phone #s on the list posted the other day were all in Washington
D.C.  --  For most of you, your elected officials will also maintain
a local office in your area code.

When I 'manage' my elected officials, I use their local office #'s
exclusively, and my fax modem and windows-print-capture software are
my tool of choice.  They see my words as I have stated them, rather
than a summary as they would if I called in /voice/ and left a
comment with the office staff.

PGP is not available on the archive site rsa.com.  If it were, it
would be highly amusing, since rsa.com (actually Public Key Partners,
but it's the same entity) is the organization holding the patents
which they claim are violated if you actually "make, use or sell" PGP.
I believe those patents also apply in Canada, but I'm not a patent
lawyer or anything.

There is no such thing as freely redistributable code for RSA which
can be used in North America without legal entanglements.  You may
wish to consider RSAREF, however, which *is* available from the FTP
site rsa.com in /rsaref but probably doesn't meet your definition of
"freely redistributable" (it's readily available in source, in C, and
does RSA, MD5, etc. and comes with a license allowing noncommercial
use.  Like any other strong crypto software, it's not exportable
legally.  It can be modified with permission from RSADSI, which a
number of people have received in the past.)  For reasons that aren't
entirely clear to me, RSA says that only U.S. people should take
RSAREF from its server, although there aren't ITAR issues regarding
Canada.  The RIPEM distribution site (ripem.msu.edu) has RSAREF in its
distribution, and is OK for Canadians.

Thank you very much. After reading the text some distinct questions
arised to me, which I guess will also be asked by other people. Perhaps
would it be interesting to find an answer to these questions ?

First question: When will the LawEnforcmentField be transmitted, and how
does the remote Clipper Chip handle it? Is it transmitted periodically
in the stream of encrypted blocks, or just at the beginning ? Does the
phone at the other side discard those packets via a protocol whatsoever,
or tries it to turn them into voice-output ? (Which would not be disturbing)

Second question: Why!?!? Why is such a strange procedure used, and not
a real RNG ? This turns those S1,S2 in a kind of bottleneck for system-
security.

So no (technical) provision will be taken to place a 'timeout' on these
warrants? This would be a unique possibility to realize such a technical
restriction, by letting the escrow-agencies perform the decoding of the
session key. Just take modem-lines instead of secure fax. Is this such
a bad idea ?

Wow! (How does the randomizer work?) Are the SHA (and Key exchange) secret,
or publicly known ? Key-Exchange is DH, I guess ?

It seems that those who are opposed to this chip shall have a tough time,
your government realy means to act. :-(

	Hate to mess up your point, but it is incredibly easy to learn how
to make a nuclear weapon.  The hard part is getting the radioactives to
put in it.  Have you ever read Tom Clancy's _The Sum of All Fears_?  It
describes in great detail how a Palestinian terrorist group constructed a
nuclear bomb using stolen (actually found) plutonium, with some help from
an East German nuclear physicist.  For some non fiction, read Tom Clancy's
article _Five Minutes Till Midnight_.  It shows how a terrorist group could
construct a nuke using Neptunium, a low grade radioactive waste product
dumped in toxic waste sites and forgotten about.  He also claims information
on constructing a nuke is easily found in any large library.  Sounds
kind of scary, doesn't it? :-(

Assume in this case the usual canard-adversary of narcotraficantes.  They
probably have more cash than the KGB did, and they're probably more generous
at handing it out.  It will be easier than ever to find or cultivate Walkers
and Pollards for the keys, and it will be easy enough to find someone to
reverse-engineer the chip (unless the tamper proofing is damned clever and
effective).

Gee. Say they feed the 80-bit key through Snefru-8 and take the first 60
bits of the result, then use those 60 bits as the real key. How do you
figure out that each key is one of 2^20 ``equal'' keys? You can try a
birthday attack, but if the key can be changed only once a second then
you will need several lifetimes to get reliable statistics. Somehow I
don't think you could catch the NSA at this sort of skulduggery.

They may collect the data, but making sense of it is another matter.

On sci.crypt I'm a graduate CS major (with strong math background) and

I could go on, but I'm sure you see my point.  I'm a single person,
but I react differently on different groups (admittedly, in part
because I'm a contrarian you always shouts "but, on the other hand...").
On top of that, I _loath_ certainty and have taken public positions
in the past for no reason other than to challenge "conventional wisdom".
I wish them luck in figuring out who "I" am based on that information.

(They can probably figure out I'm liberal, with a technical degree
but humanistic interests, from a common thread throughout my posts.
But that describes a fair portion of the users of Internet).

   That is--you get high quality secure NSA classified technology if you agree

That's the disturbing part - use of other products IS voluntary, for now,
and the press releases talk about the White House's unwillingness to
decide that citizens have a right to good commercial crypto gear,
and about how commercial alternatives will be permitted as long as
they provide key escrow services.  That's a clear implication that
they're considering banning alternatives.

Additionally, use of real alternatives ISN'T totally legal -
you're not allowed to export really good crypto equipment except to
the government's friends (e.g. the Australian government)
you can only export even BAD crypto equipment with their permission,
and the regulators who control the cellular telephone companies make
sure there are only two competitors, so Joe's Garage Cellular can't

"All" is a *very* big number.  The AT&T Long Distance network has
around 20,000 T3 trunks (45 Mbit/sec), which is on the order of 10**12 bits/sec.
That doesn't even count the amount of traffic in the LOCAL phone companies,
or our long-distance competitors.  It's about 200 Exabytes tapes / second,
which is pretty large even for the NSA :-)

On the other hand, I can easily see them recording the traffic for
"interesting" people, such as dissidents, suspected criminals,
foreign telephone calls, and anybody noticed using encryption.
As Ken Shiriff speculates, recording encrypted traffic will probably
be judged not to be an invasion of privacy pretty soon ....

Just a little nitpicking. Wasn't it the government that required
a standard railway gauge ? Didn't that improve things ?

Please don't misunderstand. I'm utter suspicious of this Clipper
chip. Why hold the design TOP SECRET ? Was this a work around the
law that says that any discoveries made by people working for the
government is public domain. ( e.g. NIH Class Library, etc. )
DES has its designs published all over the place and it is considered
fairly strong ( although could be stronger ).

  I suspect that the decisive element in the political battle will be the
FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) factor.
  If the people who would be end users of the Cripple Chip hear of the whole
debate only vaguely -- the government says it's solid; other people in the
field say it's Swiss cheese -- the balance of doubt could shift against the
Feds.  Any attempt to limit other forms of encryption could then be presented
as the government covering its own butt by protecting its poor product from
superior competition.
  Comments?
